<p>The story of <span class="smcap">Clinton</span> is designed mainly to
illustrate by example the importance of early
habits of obedience and industry; the danger of
mingling with unprincipled and vicious companions;
and the necessity of being able to say
no, when tempted to do wrong. It is also designed
to awaken in boys a stronger taste for the
quiet and innocent pursuits and pleasures of
home-life,—a taste which can hardly be overestimated,
as one of the Heaven-appointed
safeguards of youthful virtue.</p>

</div>

<p class="center no-indent fs80">“PRECEPTS MAY LEAD, BUT EXAMPLES DRAW.”</p>


<p>“<span class="smcap">The Aimwell Stories</span>” are designed to portray some
of the leading phases of juvenile character, and to point
out their tendencies to future good and evil. This they
undertake to do, by describing the quiet, natural scenes
and incidents of every-day life, in city and country, at
home and abroad, at school and upon the play-ground,
rather than by resorting to romantic adventures and
startling effects. While their main object is to persuade
the young to lay well the foundations of their characters,
to win them to the ways of virtue, and to incite them to
good deeds and noble aims, the attempt is also made to
mingle amusing, curious and useful information with the
moral lessons conveyed. It is hoped that the volumes
will thus be made attractive and agreeable, as well as instructive,
to the youthful reader.</p>

<p>Each volume of the “Aimwell Stories” will be complete
and independent of itself, although a connecting
thread will run through the whole series. The order of
the volumes, so far as completed, is as follows:</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Most</span> people on entering the little village of Brookdale
for the first time, are struck with the beauty
of its location. Those who were born there, and who
have always lived in sight of its green hills, and pleasant
valleys, and frolicsome rivulets, probably do not
think so much of these things as does the stranger who
happens to come among them, and who has an eye for
the beauty of nature. Beautiful objects often lose
their attractions when they become familiar to us.
If a man were permitted to behold the splendors of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
clear evening firmament but once in his life-time, he
would be almost enraptured with the sight; but give
him the opportunity of gazing at the stars every cloudless
night in the year, and he will seldom notice them.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="i_b014" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b014.jpg" alt="Map of Brookdale">
</figure>
<br>

<p>A range of high hills skirt the eastern side of Brookdale,
and stretch away to the north, as far as the eye
can reach. Towards the west, in a clear day, can be
seen the shadowy form of a distant mountain, looking
like a dim cloud on the horizon. Near the centre of
the village is one of those beautiful little lakes, so common
in the State of Maine. Several rivulets, fed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
springs in the hills, flow through the village during the
greater portion of the year, and empty their sparkling
waters into this lake, or pond as it is generally called.
It is from this circumstance that the town is called
Brookdale.</p>

<p>It was near the foot of one of the hills in this pleasant
little village, in a snug farm-house a story and a
half high, that Clinton lived. Mr. Davenport, his
father, had formerly been a carpenter in another part
of the State; but having a taste for farming, he gave
up his trade after he had accumulated a little property,
and bought the place of which we are speaking. He
brought with him, however, a great variety of carpenter’s
tools, and had a room fitted up for a workshop,
where he often did little jobs for himself or some
neighbor, when a rainy day kept him indoors. This
room was in the rear of the house, adjoining the pantry,
so that it was not necessary to go out of the house
to reach it. Clinton spent a great many happy hours
in this shop; for though he was only thirteen years
old, he had considerable mechanical skill, and could
handle the plane, the saw, the bit, and most of the
other tools, in quite a workmanlike style. As he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
careful not to injure the tools, his father allowed him
to use them whenever he wished.</p>

<p>There were some very creditable specimens of Clinton’s
skill at carpentry about the house, which he took
no little pride in showing to visitors, as well he might.
For instance, there was the martin-house, on a tall
pole in the garden, which was a complete miniature
model of the farm-house itself, including the long
“kitchen-end” in the rear. To make the resemblance
as close as possible, Clinton gave this bird-house two
coats of white paint, and also painted imitation windows
in black. On the barn there was another tall,
straight staff, with a vane representing a prancing
horse, all the work of Clinton’s own hands. The trellises
on each side of the front door of the house which
supported the climbing roses and honeysuckles, were
likewise his handiwork.</p>

<p>Clinton did not like to have any one show him how
to do a thing, if he could possibly get along without it.
I suppose it was for this reason that he never wanted
others to know what he was at work upon, until it was
completed. His father would sometimes laugh at him
on this account, and repeat to him the saying of Doctor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
Franklin, that the man who depends on teaching himself
will have a fool for his master. But this did not
move Clinton in his resolution. It is a good plan to
profit as much as we can by the experience and advice
of others; but after all, there are many things
to which this rule will not apply. The boy who
works out a hard sum alone, and refuses to let any
one show him how to do it, will derive much more
benefit from the exercise than though he had been assisted
by others. So, no doubt, Clinton owed no little
of his skill in carpentry to the fact that he did not run
to his father for advice and assistance every time he
met with a little difficulty.</p>

<p>Clinton had one sister, but no brothers; her name
was Annie; and she was seven years younger than
her brother. She was a beautiful child, with large,
blue eyes full of confidence and love, a fat, rosy face,
and hair that hung in golden curls about her white
shoulders. She was all gentleness and affection, and
was the pet and favorite of the household. No boy of
his age ever loved a sister more than Clinton did his.
Though she was so much younger than himself, he
spent much of his time with her, joining in sports in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
which she could take a part, or making playthings for
her amusement. It was very rarely that he allowed
himself to use an unkind or impatient word toward
her; and when he did, he was sure to repent of it, for
he could not bear the silent and sorrowful reproach of
those eyes. Annie, for her part, was proud of her
brother, and returned, with interest, all the affection
he bestowed upon her. She was sure that no other
little girl in Brookdale had such a brother; and when
this subject was talked about after school one day, she
was not a little offended with Susan Lovering, because
she persisted in maintaining that her brother Herbert
was just as good and as ingenious a boy as Clinton
Davenport. Annie thought the idea absurd, and it
was some time before she could forgive Susan for
making such a remark.</p>

<p>The only other inmate of the house I have described,
was Clinton’s mother. Mrs. Davenport was
an excellent woman, gentle and lady-like in her manners,
and extremely fond of her children. Mr. Davenport
employed one or two hired men on his farm a
portion of the year, but they did not live with the
family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>“Father,” said Clinton one day, on coming home
from the mill, and before he had alighted from the
wagon, “Father, may I keep some ducks?”</p>

<p>“Ducks! what do you want of them, Clinty?” inquired
his father.</p>

<p>“Why, I’ve just seen Jerry Preston, and he’s got
some real handsome ones, and he says I may have
four of them for a dollar.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but that isn’t answering my question. No
doubt Jerry would be glad to sell his ducks, but what
do you want of them, and what will you do with
them? We must always think of these things before
we buy anything. I am not so sure but that if you
had the ducks you would be almost as badly off as the
man who came into possession of an elephant, which
he could not keep, sell, nor give away.”</p>

<p>“Why, father,” replied Clinton, “I can build a little
house to keep them in, down by the side of the brook,
and Jerry says they will lay more than eggs enough to
pay for their keeping. They don’t need so much
grain as hens do. They look real handsome, too, sailing
on the water.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you are willing to pay for them out of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
your own money, and will provide a suitable place for
them, I don’t know as I shall object to your keeping a
few. But it seems to me you might make a better
bargain than you propose. Won’t Jerry sell you some
eggs?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know as he has any, yet, for he has just
begun to keep ducks; but I will ask him.”</p>

<p>“Do so,” said Mr. Davenport, “and if he will sell
you a dozen, at a reasonable price, you may buy
them.”</p>

<p>“But of what use will the eggs be, father, without a
duck to hatch them?” inquired Clinton.</p>

<p>“Never mind about that now,” replied his father,
“you get the eggs first, and then we will see what we
can do with them.”</p>

<p>Clinton was already somewhat largely interested in
the poultry line. When he was nine years old, his
father gave him all the fowls belonging to the farm, on
condition that he should assume the whole charge of
them, and take good care of them. There were in all
about twenty hens and chickens, and half a dozen
young turkeys. Mr. Davenport agreed to pay Clinton
for all the eggs and poultry they needed for the table,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
but Clinton must purchase with his own money whatever
was necessary for the subsistence of the fowls.
Clinton was much pleased with this arrangement;
and as he knew that when men engage in business
they usually keep account books, in which they record
all the sums they spend or receive, he procured a few
sheets of paper, with which he made a little blank
book, for this purpose. His first entry was simply an
enumeration of his fowls, with an estimate of their
value; or, as the merchant would call it, a schedule of
his stock in trade. It was as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

fowls:—</p>

<p>Whenever he sold any eggs, he entered the date,
the number sold, and the price, on a page which he
reserved for this purpose. On the opposite page, he
set down the sums which he paid his father for the
corn and meal consumed by his fowls. At the end of
the first year, he struck a balance, to use a mercantile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
expression; that is, he added up the various sums he
had received and spent, and ascertained how much he
had made by the year’s operations. His account stood

<p>Of this profit, $18,99 was in the shape of hens and
turkeys, and $4,48 in ready cash, safely deposited in
the old bureau drawer, in Clinton’s bed-room.</p>

<p>The second year, Clinton made a much larger profit
on his poultry, his father having given him a patch of
ground, where he raised with his own hand a crop of
corn sufficient to carry his fowls through the year. At
the end of this year, he had about $30,00 in money,
which his fowls had earned for him; and as he continued
every year to raise his own grain, when he was
thirteen years old, he had about $75,00 in cash, which,
at his request, his father had deposited in a bank in
Portland, where it earned him interest. In addition
to this, he had about $25,00 worth of hens and turkeys;
so that the $11,20 worth of fowls which his
father gave him, had, by his own industry and prudence,
swelled into $100 in four years.</p>

<p>The same afternoon on which the conversation upon
ducks was held, Clinton managed to run over to
Jerry’s again, to see if he could procure the eggs.
Jerry told him he had not now got enough for a litter,
but would be able to supply him in a few days. Clinton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
therefore engaged the first dozen he should have,
for which he agreed to pay 25 cents.</p>

<p>“Now, father,” said Clinton a few days after, as he
uncovered the box of eggs for which he had bargained,
“now I am ready for you.”</p>

<p>“You don’t need any assistance,” replied Mr.
Davenport; “all you have got to do, now, is to give
the eggs to Specky, and she will do the rest.”</p>

<p>Specky was one of Clinton’s hens, and this name
was given to her, on account of her speckled feathers.
She had recently taken it into her head that she
wanted to raise a family of little Speckies; but as
Clinton did not happen to coincide with her in this
matter, she had done nothing but make herself miserable
for several days. Every chance she could get, she
would jump into the nest, and commence setting, as
though she were determined to bring a chicken out of
the chalk nest-egg. When Clinton approached to
take her off the nest, she would scream and cluck with
all her might, which I suppose was her way of scolding;
and when he put her down, she would squat upon
the ground, and refuse to budge an inch. He was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
obliged to shut her up alone in a little coop, to reform
her bad manners; but she had not got over her stubbornness,
at the time Mr. Davenport told Clinton to
let her take charge of the ducks’ eggs.</p>

<p>“But,” said Clinton, on receiving this direction,
“will she set on those eggs?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied his father, “she will set on any thing
that looks like an egg, and be glad of the chance, too.
And besides, she will make a better mother to the
little ducklings than their real mother would prove.
The duck is so fond of the water, that when she once
gets into it, she is apt to forget all about her eggs, until
they get cold, and are spoilt. And if she should not
fall into this blunder, and hatches her brood successfully,
the first thing she does is to give the poor, weak
things a cold bath, no matter how chilly or stormy it
is. They can’t stand this rough treatment very well,
and for this reason it is better to let hens do the setting
and hatching, when there are any ducks to be
raised.”</p>

<p>All this was new to Clinton, as he had never had
any experience in the management of the duck family.
He followed his father’s directions, however, and as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
madame Specky seemed delighted with the arrangement,
he was satisfied. The next day, he set about
building a house for the expected new comers, down in
the meadow, by the side of the brook. This was
something of an undertaking, for a boy of his age, but
he took hold with a right good will, and by devoting to
it all the time he could spare from his other duties, he
had it completed, and ready for the ducks to move into,
long before they had begun to show their heads.</p>

<p>At this time Clinton was not attending school, for
the very good reason that there was no school in the
place. The law of the State only required that every
town should support a public school three months in
the year; and as Brookdale had but a small and
scattered population, the people did not think it advisable
to continue their school any longer than the winter
term, which lasted from the first of December to
the first of March. During this season of the year,
the lads and lasses of all ages, from six or seven years
up to eighteen or twenty, turned out and attended the
same school, and made the most of their brief opportunities
for acquiring knowledge.</p>

<p>But though there were nine months of every year<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</span>
that Clinton did not attend school, he was not allowed
to neglect his studies, during these long vacations.
Both of his parents had received good educations in
their youth, and they knew too well the value of the
benefits thus secured, to allow their children to grow
up in ignorance. Mrs. Davenport had once been a
teacher herself, and it was now but a pleasant task to
give Clinton and Annie their daily lessons, and to
listen to their recitations. Mr. Davenport, too, had
taught a school for one or two terms, when a young
man. The branches which Clinton was now studying,
were reading, writing, arithmetic, and grammar. He
was required to devote two hours to his studies, each
day, no matter how much work he had to do, or how
much he wanted to play. In the evening his mother
heard him recite, and gave him such assistance as he
needed. In this way, he made considerable progress
in his studies, though perhaps he did not learn as fast as
he could had he enjoyed school privileges all the time.
During the portion of the year he attended school, he
always ranked above other boys of his own age, and
was considered one of the best scholars in town.</p>

<p>Clinton also performed a good deal of work for his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
parents, when he did not attend school. In the spring
he used to drive the ploughing team, while his father
or the hired man guided the plough through the soil.
He likewise made himself very handy in planting
season; and in mid-summer he could rake the hay or
hoe the corn and potatoes, almost as well as a man.
He knew how to build a stone-wall, or to make a compost-heap,
or to litter and feed the oxen, or to chop
wood; for all these things, and many others, he had
been taught to do. He was not required to labor too
hard, or too long at one time; but his father wished
him to learn to work while young, believing he would
be happier if he had some useful employment for a
portion of his leisure time. And Clinton found this to
be true. He not only learned a great many useful
things, from his daily labors, but he found that after
working a few hours, he could enjoy his sports with
much more zest than if he had idled away all his time
in trying to amuse himself. Besides, it was no little
satisfaction to know that he could be of some service
to his parents, to whose care and affection he was so
greatly indebted.</p>

<p>It was thus between work, study and play, that Clinton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
divided his time. He was an intelligent, kind-hearted,
good-natured, and well-meaning boy, but——well,
we will for the present drop the vail of charity
over the unpleasant truth which belongs to the other
side of that “but.”</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">After</span> Clinton had finished his duck-house, he noticed
that the water was getting quite low in the brook.
It was the month of August, and the season had been
very hot and dry, so that the springs in the hills, which
fed the brook, had almost given out. While he was
thinking what his ducks would do for water if the
brook should dry entirely up, it occurred to him that
he might make a little pond, to be filled from the brook,
which would afford a good place for his ducks to swim,
and might also prolong the supply of water. Having
obtained his father’s consent, he set about the job at
once. He was busily at work, digging out the peat or
mud for this pond, one warm afternoon, when he happened
to look up and saw two boys by the side of him.
As their eyes met, one of them exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“An’ faith, Patrick, what are ye after doin’ now?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
Is it for goold ye are diggin’, sure? or are ye goin’ to
make a river of the brook? Why don’t ye spake,
ye bogtrotter, hey?”</p>

<p>Clinton laughed at this rough salutation, but perhaps
he felt that there was a slight tinge of unkindness
in the joke, as he turned his eye from the neat dress
of the speaker, to his own heavy boots loaded with
mud, and his coarse and well-worn pantaloons, the bottoms
of which were tucked into his boots.</p>

<p>“But you do look just like a Paddy, Clin, I’ll leave
it to Jerry if you don’t,” continued the speaker, who
was a cousin of Jerry Preston’s, and was named Oscar.</p>

<p>Jerry agreed that it was so. “But,” he continued,
“what are you trying to make, Clin? I should really
like to know.”</p>

<p>“Wait a few days and you will see,” replied Clinton.</p>

<p>“The same old story,” said Oscar, “‘wait and you’ll
see;’ you needn’t think you can get anything more
than that out of him, Jerry.”</p>

<p>“I guess he has taken a contract to dig a cellar for
somebody,” continued Jerry. “See him put in!” he
added, as Clinton resumed his work.</p>

<p>“And I guess,” said Oscar, “that he isn’t making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
anything in particular, but is only digging for amusement.
What capital fun it must be to dig mud this
warm day!”</p>

<p>Clinton made no reply to their bantering, but kept
on digging. After a minute’s pause, Jerry resumed
the conversation by saying,—</p>

<p>“Clin, you are the queerest fellow I ever saw.”</p>

<p>“How so?” inquired Clinton.</p>

<p>“Why, I never come over here but I find you hard
at work about something or other. You must love to
work better than I do.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and <em>such</em> work, too,” chimed in Oscar;
“you’re making a complete clodhopper of yourself.
You’ll be an old man before you are a young one, if
you don’t mind. Why doesn’t your father make his
men do this hard drudgery, instead of putting it upon
you?”</p>

<p>“My father doesn’t make me do this work,” replied
Clinton, with some spirit; “I’m doing it for myself,
and of my own accord.”</p>

<p>“I suppose your father doesn’t make you work at
all,” said Oscar, with a sneer in his look and voice,
which Clinton could not fail to observe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, he does require me to work,” replied Clinton,
“but no more than I ought to. I have plenty of time
for play, besides having a little left for study, too,
which is more than some boys, that I know, can
say.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” resumed Oscar, “when you aint hard at
work, digging like an Irishman, your father makes you
sit down in the house, and mope over your books. I’m
glad I havn’t got such a father to stand over me;
aint you, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“I am so,” replied Jerry. “I don’t believe in
making slaves of boys. It is time enough to go to
work when we get to be men. I mean to enjoy myself
while I am young, if I don’t any other time. But
come, Oscar, we’ve stopped here long enough,—let’s
be going.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m ready,” said Oscar, and they began to
start. Clinton, seeing that they were not directing
their steps homeward, inquired where they were going.</p>

<p>“Over to the pond,” replied Jerry, “to have a swim.
Come, wont you go too, Clinton?” he added.</p>

<p>“Yes, come with us, Clin,” said Oscar; “we shall
have a first-rate time; and as you say you can play as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
much as you please, there’s nothing to prevent your
going.”</p>

<p>Clinton did want to go with them, but his parents
and Annie had gone away that afternoon, leaving the
house in his charge, and he thought it would not be
right to leave the premises. It was true, he was not
expressly told not to go off; but Clinton knew his
father expected him to remain about the house until
their return, as he had left a message to be delivered
to Mr. Hardy, the blacksmith, who was to call at Mr.
Davenport’s that afternoon. So, after a moment’s hesitation,
Clinton answered,—</p>

<p>“I should like to go, but I don’t see how I can to-day.”</p>

<p>“Why not?” both Oscar and Jerry inquired, at the
same instant.</p>

<p>Clinton did not like to tell them his reason, for fear
they would laugh him out of it. He could not bear to
be ridiculed, and these boys knew it; for whenever
they wished to persuade him to do anything he was
not inclined to do, they generally resorted to this
weapon to effect their object. Accordingly, they began
to try its virtues in the present case. They asked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span>
him if he was afraid to go out of sight of the house
without his father’s leave, and how long he expected to
be tied to his mother’s apron-strings. They had proceeded
in this strain but a few moments, when Clinton’s’
resolution began to give out. He at first warmly
denied that he was afraid to go; and a moment after,
as if to convince them that it was not fear that kept
him at home, he threw down his shovel, and exclaimed,—</p>

<p>“I don’t care,—I believe I will go, too.”</p>

<p>So, exchanging his thick boots for a light pair of
shoes, he started for the pond with the other boys. It
was not a very long walk,—taking the shortest path
through the fields,—and they were soon tumbling and
plunging about in the cool water, in high glee. Judging
from their shouts of laughter, and the merry
splashing they made in the calm lake, you would have
supposed they were a happy set of boys. But Clinton,
at least, was not quite so happy as he seemed. Something
in his breast told him that he had done wrong in
yielding to the solicitations of his comrades. The
louder he laughed, the more plainly did he hear the
voice within, saying, “Ah! Clinton, you have made a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
false step; you have yielded to a foolish temptation;
you have disobeyed your father; you have betrayed
his confidence,—and all for a few moments’ gratification.”
He tried to drive these unpleasant thoughts
from his mind, but they would not leave him. He was
careful, however, not to let his companions see any
traces of his uneasiness.</p>

<p>When they had been in the water nearly an hour,
Clinton proposed returning home; but neither Oscar
nor Jerry seemed inclined to do so. After waiting a
little longer, Clinton concluded to go home alone, and
proceeded to dry and dress himself. The other boys
were so absorbed in their sport, that they scarcely
noticed what he was doing.</p>

<p>Just as Clinton was about to start for home, Oscar
took it into his head to have a sail on the lake. There
was a sail-boat anchored a little way from the shore,
near where they were bathing, which belonged to
Squire Walcott. Oscar proposed to take possession of
this boat, and Jerry readily fell in with his plan. The
water where the boat lay was so shallow they could
wade out to it; so they proceeded to dress themselves,
preparatory to their excursion. Clinton knew that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
Squire was very obliging, and was always willing to
lend his boat to any one who knew how to manage it;
and he was sorry that the boys were going to take it
without leave. Indeed, he even remonstrated with
them about it. But the only reply he got, was this
from Oscar:—</p>

<p>“Who cares for old Walcott? Besides, he needn’t
know anything about it, unless you go and tell him.
You may go home, if you choose, but I’m bound to
have a sail.”</p>

<p>Clinton got home before his parents returned; and,
fortunately for him, Mr. Hardy came along soon after,
and the message was delivered, so that this burden
was removed from his conscience. He did not, however,
feel exactly right in his mind; for though no
harm had resulted from his absence, he had been
guilty of something like a breach of trust, and his
conscience continued to reprove him.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="i_b038" style="max-width: 58.3125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b038.jpg" alt="The boat aground">
</figure>
<br>

<p>Jerry and Oscar amused themselves on the pond, for
an hour longer; but though both of them attempted to
act the skipper, neither knew much about managing a
boat, and the result was, they run themselves aground,
at a place where the bottom was soft mud, and were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
unable to get afloat again. It was half a mile from
their starting place, and they did not know how they
should get the boat back to its anchoring ground.
They got into the water, and tried to push it off, but it
refused to go. At length, wearied with their exertions,
and with their clothes wet and dirty, they concluded to
wade ashore, and leave the stolen boat to take care of
itself. In going home, they avoided the road, as much
as possible, and skulked through the woods, lest they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
should be seen; but after they had reached their home,
and considered themselves beyond the danger of discovery,
they began to treat the affair as a joke, and
laughed to think how mad “old Walcott” would be,
when he found his boat aground, half a mile from the
place where it belonged. They did not seem to realize
that they had acted meanly and wickedly, in taking
possession without leave, of Squire Walcott’s boat, and in
leaving it aground, without informing him of its whereabouts.
If they could escape detection, it mattered
little to them whether their conduct had been right or
wrong.</p>

<p>These two boys were unlike Clinton, in many respects.
Jerry,—or, to give, him his full name, Jeremiah
Preston,—lived in the nearest farm-house to
Mr. Davenport’s.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> There was more than half a mile’s
distance between the two families; but as there were
no nearer neighbors, they were on pretty intimate
terms. Jerry was but a few months older than Clinton,
and the two boys had been playmates almost from
the cradle. Mr. Preston was engaged in the logging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
and lumbering business, which required him to be
away from home, in the forests, a large portion of the
year. As Jerry’s mother did not succeed very well in
governing her household, the long and frequent absences
of Mr. Preston from his family were unfortunate
for the children, especially for Jerry, who was the
eldest child, and the only son. During the few months
of each year the father spent at home, he was more
inclined to humor his children, than to train them to
obedience. Sometimes, it is true, in a moment of passion,
he would punish Jerry severely, for some offence;
but at another time, he would entirely overlook a much
more serious fault. Under the influence of this bad
training, it is not strange that Jerry was getting to be
an ungovernable and mischievous boy.</p>

<p>Oscar Preston was a cousin to Jerry, who had recently
come from Boston, to spend a few months in
Brookdale. He was about a year older than Jerry, in
age, but was several years his senior in bad habits.
He had in fact become almost unmanageable at home,
and it was on this account, as well as to get him away
from the evil influences of the city, that his father sent
him into the country. He had never been taught to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
labor, and as he now had nothing to do, and there was
no school to attend, and no one to restrain him, he did
not seem to grow much better by his banishment from
home. It is said that idleness is the mother of mischief,
and Oscar furnished daily proof of the truth of
the saying. His adventure with the boat is but a
specimen of the way in which he amused himself.</p>

<p>The influence of Oscar Preston upon the other boys
in the village, and especially upon Jerry, from whom
he was seldom separated, soon became very perceptible.
He had seen more of the world than they, and
never wearied of telling of the wonders of the city,
often exaggerating his stories, to make them the more
marvellous. In addition to this, he was naturally
bright and intelligent, and was more genteelly dressed
than the village boys; but the qualities that contributed
most to his influence over his associates, were
his daring spirit, and his imperious, commanding bearing,
which seemed to mark him for a leader. But he
had been permitted to have his own way so long at
home, that he had become headstrong and unmanageable;
and his evil passions were daily growing
stronger, while the voice of conscience within him was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
as rapidly becoming weaker. It is sad, indeed, to see
a youth growing up in this manner, for he is like the
sailor who should go to sea in a frail boat, without
anchor, rudder, or compass. He may be delivered from
early destruction, through the mercy of Providence,
but he will not escape many struggles and losses.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Clinton’s</span> brood of ducks at length made their
appearance, just one month after he had put the
eggs to the hen. There were eight of them, four of
the eggs having produced nothing. If madame Specky
was a little astonished at the singular appearance
which her children presented, she kept it all to herself,
like a good, prudent mother, for she behaved toward
them just the same as though they were ordinary
chickens. She did not appear to think anything
strange of their large bills, or their clumsy, webbed
feet, or their awkward, waddling gait. If a dog or
cat ventured near them, or a hawk happened to sail
through the air, hen never put on bolder front than
did mistress Specky. And there was need enough for
all her courage, for her young family had so little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
control over their big feet, that they never could have
saved themselves by their legs, had a foe invaded the
premises.</p>

<p>For several days after the ducks were hatched, they
continued about the poultry-yard, ignorant as yet that
there was such a thing as water, except as they had
made its acquaintance in the little tin pan from which
they were accustomed to drink. Clinton’s father had
told him that it was a good plan to keep them from
water for the first three or four days, as they were so
tender as to be easily injured by cold and dampness.
On the fifth day, Clinton concluded to introduce them
to their new home; so, gathering up the ducklings into
a basket, and taking the hen under his arm, he carried
them down to the brook, where he had made the duck-house
and pond before-mentioned. It was now about
the middle of September, and the brook was nearly
dry; but the little round pond contained plenty of
water. This pond received all the water that came
down in the brook; and there was a dam, at the lower
side of it, so that the water could not pass on its way,
until it had filled the pond, and flowed over the dam.
The pond was thus kept full, all the time, but it could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
be easily emptied, when necessary, by opening a gate
which Clinton had made in the dam.</p>

<p>Clinton had no sooner deposited his basket of ducklings
by the side of the pond, than they all seemed
possessed to get into the water. Away they ran, pell
mell, and before their cautious and anxious mother
could warn them of their danger, every one of them
had launched away into the new element. And now
they were as graceful and beautiful as they had been
ungainly and ugly. They glided along over the water
as naturally and elegantly as does the new ship on its
first entrance upon its destined element. Annie, who
had come to witness the scene, was delighted with the
sight, and clapped her hands in glee, exclaiming:—</p>

<p>“O, isn’t it beautiful, Clinty? Look! look! see that
cunning little one duck its head into the water!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Clinton, without turning to look at the
sight which so pleased Annie, “yes, and only see what
a fuss the old hen is making on the bank! Look
quick! Ha, ha, ha!” and the boy, whose love of the
ludicrous was as strong as his sister’s love of the beautiful,
burst into a hearty laugh. Nor did he laugh
without a reason. Madame Specky, good, honest old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
hen that she was, had never seen such strange doings
before, and she was greatly alarmed for the safety of
her brood. So she stood by the side of the pond,
clucking and calling with all her might, and with her
wings partially opened, as if to receive back her
naughty children. Her neck was stretched out yearningly
towards them, and she was so excited that she
could not stand still a moment, but kept dancing, like
a boy whose legs are undergoing that peculiar tingling
sensation produced by a smart switching with a birch
rod. There was horror in her eye, and frenzy in her
attitude. But the little ducks, who were the innocent
authors of all this alarm, were sailing about as calmly
as though nothing unusual had happened. Clinton
and Annie remained with them a long time, now admiring
the graceful movements of the ducks, and now
laughing at the distraction of the old hen, as she tried
in vain to call them ashore. After a while, Clinton
carried them all to the duck-house, and shut them up
for the remainder of the day, that they might get used
to their new home.</p>

<p>Mr. Davenport was at this time engaged in getting
a piece of land ready for a crop of winter wheat, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
he required the assistance of Clinton a considerable
portion of each day. The field had to be broken up
and manured, and the soil finely pulverized, to prepare
it for the seed, which must be sown early in the fall,
and not in the spring, like most other seeds. Mr.
Davenport always did thoroughly whatever he undertook.
His motto was, “If a thing is worth doing at
all, it is worth doing well;” and a very good motto it
is. Clinton sometimes thought his father was more
particular about his work than was necessary; he certainly
took more pains than some of his neighbors did.
But somehow or other, he always seemed to get paid
back liberally for his extra care, by better and larger
crops than those could show who were less particular
about their work. Mr. Davenport was especially
anxious to have the ground well prepared for this
crop, because it was an experiment; he never before
having attempted to raise winter wheat. Indeed, but
very little of this grain had ever been raised in the
State, and it was yet uncertain whether the climate
was favorable to its production. He therefore determined
to give it a fair trial, not only to satisfy his
own mind, but that others might be benefited by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
experiment; for if he and his neighbors could raise
their own flour, instead of sending several hundred
miles for it, he thought it was very important that they
should know it. Were it not for such men as he, who
are willing to enter into patient and careful experiments,
for the common benefit, the world would make
but slow progress in improvement.</p>

<p>The land was at length about ready for the seed.
Clinton had worked pretty hard for several days, and
as the family arose from their noon meal, Mr. Davenport
said:—</p>

<p>“Well, Clinty, I hope you wont get sick of raising
wheat before we have planted it. You have had a
pretty hard time, and I think you must be tired. You
need not go into the field this afternoon, but you may
tackle up Fanny, and drive over to Mr. Fletcher’s, and
get the seed-wheat that I bought of him. Get back as
early as you can, as I want to have the seed cleaned
to-night, and ready to put into the ground to-morrow
morning.”</p>

<p>Clinton was not sorry to hear this announcement of
his afternoon’s work; for though he was not a lazy boy,
it really seemed to him, that just then a ride to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
Cross-Roads would be quite as pleasant as an afternoon
spent at work in the field. So Fanny was soon
harnessed into the wagon, and Clinton started on his
errand.</p>

<p>Mr. Fletcher was a trader, who kept a store at the
Cross-Roads,—a place where two of the main highways
of the county cross each other at right angles,
thus ✛.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> Quite a thrifty little village had sprung up
at this point, boasting, among other things, a school-house,
a church, a post-office, and a “variety store.”
It was, in fact, the centre of life and business for the
surrounding dozen miles. Though about five miles
from Mr. Davenport’s house, there was no other store
or church within twice the distance. His family, consequently,
had almost come to regard the Cross-Roads
settlement as a part of their own village, though it was
actually situated in another township.</p>

<p>Clinton had not driven half way to his destination,
when he discovered two lads in advance of him, walking
the same way he was going. On coming up with
them, he found that they were Oscar and Jerry, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
were out on a gunning excursion,—Oscar having borrowed
a fowling-piece of a young man who lived near
Mr. Preston’s.</p>

<p>“Halloo, Clin, give us a ride,” exclaimed Oscar, as
the wagon drew up to them; and without further ceremony,
both boys jumped into the vehicle.</p>

<p>“Where are you going?” inquired Clinton, as he
started the horse.</p>

<p>“O, wherever you please,—we are not at all particular,”
replied Oscar. “Jerry and I have been trying
to pop off some birds, this afternoon, but the little
fools won’t stop long enough to let us shoot them.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad of it,” replied Clinton, dryly.</p>

<p>“Why are you glad?” asked Jerry.</p>

<p>“Because it’s too bad to shoot them,” replied Clinton.
“I like to see and hear them too well, to harm
them. If I could have my way, there shouldn’t be a
bird shot, unless they were crows or hawks, or something
of that kind.”</p>

<p>“Pooh,” said Oscar; “I should like to know what
birds were made for, if it wasn’t to be shot. You
don’t know what fine sport it is to shoot them, or you
would be as fond of gunning as I am.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>Oscar had probably shot half a dozen poor little
birds in the course of his life, and severely frightened
as many more. But he had got the idea that gunning
was a fine, manly amusement, and he already fancied
himself to be quite an accomplished sportsman. And
if the disposition could have made him a successful
hunter, he would have been one; for he wanted to take
the life of every bird and squirrel that he saw. He
soon found, however, that it was easier to fire than to
hit; and in most of his excursions, his powder-flask
was emptied much faster than his game-bag was
filled.</p>

<p>The boys continued their conversation, and soon
reached the Cross-Roads. Driving the wagon up to
Mr. Fletcher’s store, Clinton alighted, but on trying
the door, he found it locked. Mr. Fletcher had evidently
stepped out for a few minutes, and Clinton was
about to hitch the horse to the post, and await his return,
when Oscar proposed driving round to the
“Falls,” instead of waiting there. Clinton at first refused;
but Jerry and Oscar both joined in the request
so earnestly, that he soon began to parley and hesitate,
and finally ended by reluctantly yielding to their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
proposition. He accordingly jumped into the wagon,
and turned the face of Fanny towards the Falls.</p>

<p>The lake, or pond, which has been before alluded to,
has one outlet,—a little stream which flows away in a
south-westerly direction, finally discharging into a
larger river, which finds its way to the ocean. This
little stream, which goes by the simple name of “The
River,” in Brookdale, passes near by the Cross-Roads.
About a mile beyond that village, it comes to a wild,
romantic, down-hill place, where the waters tumble
about, and frolic among the rocks, as though they
really enjoyed the sport. This place is called “The
Falls,” the descent of the river here being very
marked. It is off from the common roads, the only
way of reaching it being by a “wood-road,”—a sort of
path through the forest, used by the teams in hauling
wood. The very seclusion of the spot, however, made
it the more charming, and it was often resorted to by
pleasure parties in the summer.</p>

<p>The road through the woods being narrow and
rough, Clinton could not drive very swiftly; but he
and his companions talked fast enough to make up for
their slow progress. They had not proceeded very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>
far in this road, when Oscar drew from his pocket a
small package, enveloped in a piece of paper, which
he began to unroll slowly, and with a very knowing
and significant look. The contents proved to be three
cigars. Holding them out in his hand, he exclaimed:—</p>

<p>“How lucky! just one a-piece. Now, boys, for a
good smoke. Take one, Clin; and here, Jerry, is one
for you.”</p>

<p>Jerry took the cigar offered, but Clinton shook his
head, saying that he did not smoke.</p>

<p>“You don’t know what you lose, then,” said Oscar.
“I’ve smoked these two or three years, and I couldn’t
live without my cigar, now. You can’t imagine how
much pleasure there is in it. Come, just try this, and
see if it isn’t nice.”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Clinton, “I don’t wish to. Father
hates tobacco, in every shape, and he wouldn’t like it
if he knew I smoked.”</p>

<p>“But this is all prejudice,” added Oscar. “Smoking
never hurt me, yet, and nobody can make me believe
that there is any harm in it. I felt a little sickish for a
few minutes, the first time, but that was nothing.
Come, try it, Clin,” he added, as he drew a match from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
his pocket, and lighted his own cigar; “try it—it
can’t hurt you,—and besides, your father needn’t
know anything about it.”</p>

<p>“Here goes mine,” said Jerry, as he touched off a
match, and applied the fire to his cigar. “<em>My</em> father
wont object, I know, for he smokes himself like everything;
and if he did object, I guess it wouldn’t make
much difference. I don’t intend to be a boy all my
life-time.”</p>

<p>The two young smokers were soon puffing away
in good earnest. Oscar was an old hand at the
business, and Jerry had been practising pretty diligently
since his city cousin came to live with him.
Between each whiff, however, they renewed their assaults
upon the good resolution of their comrade; and
so skilfully and perseveringly did they conduct the attack,
that Clinton, after a while, began to think it
looked a little unsocial and obstinate to refuse to participate
in their enjoyment. By the time they had
reached the Falls, he had concluded to yield to their
wishes. He accordingly drove Fanny into the water,
and unhitched her bridle, that she might drink and
cool herself. The three boys then threw themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
down upon the grass, beneath a large tree, and prepared
to enjoy the scene, and at the same time repose
their limbs. Clinton lighted his cigar,—and now
commenced his first experience in tobacco. He was
pleased with the new sensation; and as he lay upon
his back, watching the delicate wreaths of smoke
ascending from his cigar, and listening to Oscar,—who
was spinning out one of his long yarns about a
military muster he once witnessed in Boston,—the
time flew by much faster than he was aware. His
cigar had half disappeared, and those of his companions
were nearly used up, when he happened to notice
that the sun was fast declining, and would soon go
down behind the tops of the tall pines on the other side
of the stream. Tossing his cigar into the water, he
jumped up, saying:—</p>

<p>“Come, boys, this wont do,—we must be on our
way home.”</p>

<p>“What’s your hurry?” inquired Jerry; “it isn’t
four o’clock yet.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps it isn’t,” replied Clinton, “but I ought to
have been at home by this time. Come, jump in, and
I will turn the horse round.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span></p>

<p>The boys got into the wagon, and were soon slowly
threading their way out of the woods. In about half
an hour they reached Mr. Fletcher’s, where Clinton
stopped, and got the bags of seed. He had now a
pretty good load, and much of the way being up hill,
he did not get along very fast. Oscar and Jerry
talked as fast as usual, but Clinton looked sober, and
did not seem inclined to say much. Indeed, he hardly
spoke to them, from the time they left the store until
they reached the house where Oscar and Jerry lived,
when he bade them good afternoon, and drove on.</p>

<p>The fact was, Clinton was suffering the penalty of
his first cigar, but he did not like to confess it, and this
was the reason why he said nothing. Soon after he
started from the Falls, he began to experience a sinking,
nauseating feeling in his stomach, and every jolt
and jerk of the wagon seemed to increase it. He concealed
his feelings from Oscar and Jerry, as much as
he could, and after they had alighted, he hurried home
as fast as possible.</p>

<p>It was past six o’clock when Clinton drove into the yard
at home. His father, who had begun to feel anxious
at his long absence, had come in from the field, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
on seeing Clinton, he called out to him, somewhat
sharply,</p>

<p>“Where have you been all the afternoon, Clinton?
I’ve been waiting for you more than two hours.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Fletcher wasn’t there, and I had to wait for
him,” replied Clinton. “Besides, it was so warm I
thought I wouldn’t drive very fast.” Ah, Clinton,
have you forgotten that it is a falsehood to tell but half
the truth?</p>

<p>Clinton had begun to unharness the horse, when he
became so faint and dizzy that he was obliged to stop;
and before he could get into the house, he began to
vomit. His father, hearing the noise, ran to his aid,
and led him into the house. The pale, deathly look
of Clinton, as his father assisted him into the sitting-room,
was the first notice his mother received that he
was ill. She was somewhat startled by the suddenness
of his entrance, and at first thought that he had got
hurt.</p>

<p>“Mercy on us! what has happened?” was her first
exclamation.</p>

<p>“Nothing alarming,” replied Clinton; “I am a little
sick at my stomach—that is all.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>“How long have you been so?” inquired his mother.</p>

<p>“Only a little while,” was the reply. “I haven’t
felt very smart for an hour or two, but just as I got
home I began to grow worse, and have been vomiting.”</p>

<p>“Have you eaten any thing this afternoon?” inquired
Mr. Davenport.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied Clinton, “nothing since dinner.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid he has worked too hard lately,” remarked
Mrs. Davenport to her husband. “You have
kept him at it pretty steadily for a week past, and
you know he isn’t so rugged as many boys are. I
wouldn’t allow him to work so hard again.”</p>

<p>“He <em>has</em> been working pretty hard, I know,” observed
Mr. Davenport; “but he has never complained before,
and I did not suppose he suffered from it. I don’t
think this is anything serious, wife—he needs a little
physic, perhaps, or something of that sort, to regulate
his system.”</p>

<p>While this conversation was taking place, Clinton
sat in the rocking-chair, leaning his head upon his
hand. Little Annie stood by his side, silent and sad,
her large, loving eyes looking up wonderingly at her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</span>
sick brother. But he did not notice her. He was
thinking very earnestly of something else. His conscience
was busily at work, reproaching him for his
conduct during the afternoon. “You disobeyed your
father,” it plainly said, “by going over to the Falls,
when he told you to come right home. You deceived
him, after you got home, by not giving the true reason
for your long absence. You made yourself sick by
smoking that cigar, and now you sit still and hear your
parents, in their sympathy and solicitude, attribute
your illness to hard work. O Clinton, you have not
only done very wrong, but you have done it very
<em>meanly</em>, too! No wonder you cover up your face, and
dare not meet the eye of your parents.”</p>

<p>Thus was conscience talking. At first, Clinton almost
resolved to confess the whole story of his wrong-doings.
“Do it,” said conscience; but shame whispered,
“no, don’t expose yourself—you will soon feel
better, and the whole affair will be forgotten in a day
or two.” The longer he hesitated, between these two
advisers, the less inclined did he feel to make the confession.
His father soon went out, to put up the horse,
and his mother set about preparing him a bowl of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
thoroughwort tea—her favorite medicine, in all common
forms of sickness. Clinton already began to feel
much better, and on the whole he thought he would
say nothing about the adventures of the afternoon.
When his mother brought him the herb tea, he drank
it down as fast as possible, but he could not help making
a wry face over it, for it was not very palatable to
his taste. His mother thought he had better go to
bed early, and without eating any supper, and he complied
with her wishes. Just as he was beginning to
doze, a gentle, timid voice awakened him, saying,</p>

<p>“Clinty, you won’t be sick, will you?”</p>

<p>“No, sis,” he answered, and with a parting “good-night,”
he fell asleep—not the sweet, calm sleep to
which he was accustomed, but fitful, troubled dreams,
in which the unpleasant events of the afternoon flitted
before him, in an exaggerated and grotesque, but always
sad and reproachful panorama.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">An</span> icicle is hanging over the window by which I
write. A day or two ago, it was hardly perceptible,
but it has gone on, increasing in size, until now it
is as large round as my arm, and full as long. It is
nothing, however, but an innumerable collection of
little drops of water, frozen together. One by one
they chased each other down the roof above, but on
coming to the cold icicle, they became chilled, and
were congealed into a part of itself, some of them running
down to its slender tip, and others fastening themselves
upon its sides, or its inverted base.</p>

<p>It is thus that evil habits are formed—drop by
drop, and atom by atom. One wrong act prepares the
way for another. One bad habit invites and attracts
others. Thus the little one soon becomes a troop, and
the feeble enemy swells into a formidable giant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span></p>

<p>Oscar and Jerry were fast descending the downward
path of evil. Having nothing else to employ themselves
about, mischief-making became the main business
of their lives. They were away from home a
large portion of the time; and as Mr. Preston was
glad to have them go off, for the sake of quiet and
peace at home, he seldom troubled himself to inquire
where they went, or what they did. Complaints, however,
sometimes reached him of their misconduct,
which he passed over in silence, or angrily rebuked or
punished, as he happened to feel.</p>

<p>One day, as Oscar and Jerry were making one of
their excursions about the town, they noticed some
fine-looking pears, growing on a small dwarf tree in a
garden. No person was in sight, and the blinds of
that portion of the house from which they could be
seen were all closed. There seemed to be nothing to
prevent their helping themselves, and after deliberating
a moment, and turning their eyes in every direction,
with an assumed air of carelessness, they noiselessly
entered the gate, and commenced stripping the tree
of its rich burden. The tree was not much higher
than Oscar’s head, and there were but half a dozen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
pears upon it, all of which were quickly transferred to
the pockets of the boys.</p>

<p>The act was not committed so secretly as the young
thieves imagined. Mr. Upham, to whom the fruit belonged,
was at work threshing, in the barn, and from
a back window observed Oscar and Jerry as they came
along the road. Knowing the mischievous propensities
of the boys, he kept an eye upon them, until he
saw them reach forth to pluck the fruit, when he seized
a whip, and ran towards them. The last pear was in
their pockets before they saw him approaching, and
all they had to do, therefore, was to run with all speed,
which they lost no time in doing. Mr. Upham pursued
them, several rods, but finding that their young
legs were more nimble and light-footed than his, he
soon gave up the unequal chase.</p>

<p>Towards noon, when Mr. Upham supposed the boys
would be at home to dinner, he tackled his horse and
rode over to Mr. Preston’s. As he saw Jerry’s father
in the barn, he advanced towards him, calling out in his
rough way:—</p>

<p>“Hulloo, Preston, where are those boys of yours,
Oscar and Jerry?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span></p>

<p>“They are somewhere about here,—I heard them
a minute ago,” replied Mr. Preston; “why, what do
you want of them?”</p>

<p>“I’ve come over here on purpose to give the young
whelps a good trimming, or to get you to do it,” said Mr.
Upham, making a very significant gesture with his whip,
which he had brought with him from the wagon. He
then told Mr. Preston the story of the robbery, adding
that the fruit was a new and choice species, which he
had cultivated with much care, and this was the first
crop. He said he would rather have given five dollars
than lost it, as he wished to ascertain what the fruit
was. “Now,” he added, “I am determined that these
rogues shall not go unpunished. If you’ll give them
their deserts, well and good; or if you will delegate
me to do it, it’s all the same; but if you won’t do either,
I’ll lodge a complaint against them with Squire Walcott,
before sun-down. I’ve had fruit stolen before, but
never could catch the rascals; and I shan’t let this
chance go of giving them justice, now that I am sure
who they are.”</p>

<p>“I don’t blame you in the least,” said Mr. Preston;
“if there’s anything that I’ll punish my children for,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
it’s for stealing. Jerry shall be whipped for this; but
I don’t know about whipping Oscar. He is not a child
of mine, but is only here on a visit, and I don’t exactly
feel as though I had authority to correct him.”</p>

<p>“Will you give me leave to do it, then?” said Mr.
Upham.</p>

<p>“I can’t give you an authority I don’t myself possess,”
replied Mr. Preston. “No doubt he is the greatest
rogue in this matter, and deserves a good trouncing.
You can punish him on your own responsibility, if you
choose, and I will not object; only let it be reasonable.”</p>

<p>“That’s enough,” said Mr. Upham; “now let us
find the rogues.”</p>

<p>“I think I heard them up in the hay-loft last,” remarked
Mr. Preston, and they accordingly directed
their steps thither.</p>

<p>The boys, on coming home from their marauding
excursion, had gone up into the hay-loft, and were in
the act of eating their plunder, when they were startled
by Mr. Upham’s well-known voice. Their first impulse
was to effect a hasty retreat; but this proved to
be a difficult thing to do. They could not go down below<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
without being seen. There were two windows,
but they were too far from the ground to afford escape.
There was no place where they could conceal themselves,
and they finally concluded to keep still, and
hear the result of the interview.</p>

<p>“Here they are,” said Mr. Preston, as he reached
the top stair.</p>

<p>“So they are,” echoed Mr. Upham,—his eye lighting
up with something like joy. “You see, boys,” he
added, “it didn’t do you much good to run, did it?”</p>

<p>“I suppose you heard what we were talking about,
below, Oscar?” said Mr. Preston.</p>

<p>A sullen, almost inaudible “Yes,” was the response.</p>

<p>“Then you know our business,” added Mr. Preston;
“and, as it is dinner-time, we won’t waste any more
words about it. Mr. Upham, there’s your boy,” he
continued, pointing to Oscar.</p>

<p>Oscar, though generally bold and daring, and little
disposed to show respect or fear for his superiors,
seemed completely cowed down in the presence of Mr.
Upham. Whether it was the latter’s Herculean limbs,
and rough, blunt manners, or the threat of prosecution,
that produced this result, certain it is, that all thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</span>
of resistance had vanished. He took off his jacket, at
the command of Mr. Upham, and submitted with
almost lamb-like meekness to the heavy shower of
blows that fell upon his back. The same operation
was then performed upon Jerry, by his father, after
which the boys, with red, swollen eyes, and backs well-scored
and sore, and hearts rankling with suppressed
rage, betook themselves to the house.</p>

<p>Such a punishment, inflicted in a spirit of revenge,
and in the heat of passion, and without any attempt to
appeal to the reason and consciences of the offenders,
or to awaken contrition in their hearts, could have but
one effect, and that a most injurious one, upon Oscar
and Jerry. It hardened them in their sin, and
awakened a feeling of bitter hatred towards the man
who had been the instigator of their punishment. Instead
of repenting of the evil they had done they
were already plotting still worse things against him.
They appeased the smartings of the rod with the
thought that, some day or other, they would have their
revenge.</p>

<p>Week after week passed away, and Jerry and his
cousin continued to follow their accustomed manner of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
life. For a day or two after the events just related,
some distance and coolness were perceptible between
them and Mr. Preston; but nothing more was said
about the affair, and it was soon apparently forgotten.</p>

<p>One pleasant afternoon in October, a man on horseback
rode in great haste to Mr. Davenport’s, and informed
him that the woods were on fire, just beyond
the hills, in the north or upper part of the town, and
requested him to go over and assist in putting it out.
The messenger carried the same news to most of the
other houses in the village; and, in the course of an
hour, quite a number of men and boys had assembled
at the scene of the conflagration. Some thirty or forty
cords of wood, which had been cut and seasoned, ready
for use, were found to be well on fire. The mass of
coals and flame sent out a fierce heat, so that no one
could approach very near. The fire had communicated
to many of the standing trees, and was roaring and
crackling with great fury, leaping from branch to
branch, and from tree to tree, everything being almost
as dry as tinder. It had evidently been burning a considerable
time; but the hills, which separated the wood-lot
from the principal part of the village, had prevented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
the smoke being seen. The people who had collected
could do little or nothing to stay the progress of the
flames, now that they were under such headway, and
it was not until several acres were burnt over, that the
fire began to go down. It finally went out, only because
there were no more trees to burn, it having
reached a space which had previously been cleared by
the axe.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="i_b069" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b069.jpg" alt="The fire in the woods">
</figure>
<br>

<p>The wood-lot and corded wood destroyed by this fire
belonged to Mr. Upham, and his loss was about a hundred
dollars. It was the common opinion among the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
town’s people that the fire must have originated in the
carelessness of some boys or men who happened to
pass through the wood-lot. Mr. Upham, however, had
formed a different opinion from this, but he said nothing
about it that afternoon. The next day he started off
early after breakfast, with the determination of finding
some clue to the mystery, if it were a possible thing.
In the course of the day he visited many of the people
in the village, and gathered several items of information,
which he thought might have a bearing on the
mystery he was striving to solve. Among others thus
visited, were Mr. Davenport and his son, and the latter
put Mr. Upham in possession of a certain fact which
greatly confirmed his suspicions.</p>

<p>The result of these investigations was, that Mr. Merriam,
the constable, called at Mr. Preston’s house early
the following morning, with a warrant, empowering
him to “seize the bodies” of Oscar and Jerry, and bring
them before Squire Walcott, to answer to the charge
of setting fire to Mr. Upham’s wood. The family were
just finishing their breakfast, when Mr. Merriam entered.
Taking Mr. Preston alone into the entry, he
showed him the warrant, telling him there were suspicions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
that Oscar and Jerry knew something about the
fire, and it was thought advisable to have the matter
examined. “I hope it won’t amount to anything,” he
continued, “but if there are suspicions about, they
ought to be cleared up. It is unpleasant business, and
I thought I would manage it as quietly as possible.
Perhaps you had better say nothing to the family, now;
but tell your boys you want them to go with me, of an
errand, and you can jump in too, and ride down with
us. Wouldn’t that be the best way to manage it?”</p>

<p>Mr. Preston seemed much affected by the intelligence
which was thus kindly broken to him. The mere
fact that his son and nephew were <em>suspected</em> of a crime
which might send them to a prison, went like an arrow
to his heart. The warrant, it should be observed,
charged the boys named with setting fire to the wood
wilfully and maliciously, and with intent to destroy the
same. After a moment’s silence, he obtained sufficient
command over his feelings to say:—</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Mr. Merriam, what facts have come
to light, but I have no reason to suppose that my boys
had anything more to do with the fire than you or I.
And if they did have a hand in it, it isn’t at all likely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
that it was anything more serious than an accident.
But as you say, we had better keep quiet about it, until
the subject is investigated. I will call the boys, and
we will go down to the Squire’s immediately.”</p>

<p>The little party got into the carriage, and drove
towards Squire Walcott’s. Oscar and Jerry, who had
suspected the nature of Mr. Merriam’s errand from the
first, had now no doubt that their suspicions were correct.
The silence of Mr. Merriam, and the sad and
anxious expression on the face of Mr. Preston, told
them that something unusual was about to transpire.
They asked no questions, however, but all rode on in
silence. On reaching the Squire’s, the boys were conducted
into the sitting-room, where they seated themselves
with the constable. Mr. Preston went into the
“front room,” or parlor, where there were several other
men. The time appointed for the examination not
having quite arrived, and several of the witnesses
summoned being yet absent, Oscar and Jerry remained
in the sitting-room nearly an hour, before any one
spoke to them. It was a long and dreary hour. Their
tongues were silent, but their thoughts were busy, and
their eyes glanced anxiously at every footstep.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE EXAMINATION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Squire</span> Walcott, like most of the inhabitants
of Brookdale, was a farmer. He was somewhat
advanced in years, and his son-in-law lived in the same
house with him, and assisted in carrying on the farm.
He was generally known as “The Squire,” in town,—a
title which he acquired from the circumstance of his
holding a commission as Justice of the Peace. This
commission is conferred by the Governor of the State,
and empowers the holder to discharge certain judicial
functions, such as the issuing of writs and warrants, the
examination of persons accused of crime, etc. In cases
where the offence is very small, the Justice of the
Peace may himself impose a fine, or other lawful penalty;
but if the offence is one of much magnitude, he
must bind over the supposed offender in a sum of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
money, or commit him to jail, to await a trial before a
higher court.</p>

<p>The examination on the present occasion, was to be
held in the front room of Squire Walcott’s house. When
the time arrived to commence, one of the men present
conducted Oscar into the room. As he took the seat pointed
out to him, and cast his eye about the room, he
recognized Mr. Upham, Mr. Davenport, Mr. Preston,
Clinton, and several others of the town’s people. All
eyes were turned towards himself, as if anxious to detect
from his appearance whether he were guilty or innocent.
With all his boldness, he felt his courage
failing him, as he encountered the searching glances
of one and another; and although he tried to look
indifferent, alarm was written too plainly on his pale
face to be disguised.</p>

<p>The Squire sat in a chair, with a table before him,
on which were several books, with pen, ink and paper.
In a pleasant tone of voice, he informed Oscar of the
charge brought against him, and expressed the hope
that he would be able to establish his innocence. “Before
reading the complaint,” he added, “I wish to say,
that you are not obliged to criminate yourself in this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
matter. You can plead guilty, or not guilty, as you
choose. But if you <em>did</em> have any hand in the fire, I
would, as your friend, advise you to confess the whole
at once. By so doing, you will not add to your guilt
by falsehood, and the law will deal more leniently with
you than it would if you should be proved guilty contrary
to your own assertions. Even if you set the
wood on fire, you may have done it accidentally, or in
sport, without thinking of the consequences. If you
had any connection at all with the fire, I would advise
you to state the facts, exactly as they occurred.”</p>

<p>The Squire then read the complaint, charging Oscar
Preston with setting the wood on fire. When he had
concluded, he added:—</p>

<p>“What do you say to this, Oscar,—are you guilty
or not guilty?”</p>

<p>“Not guilty,” replied Oscar, faintly.</p>

<p>The Squire now requested the complainant to produce
his evidence against the accused. Mr. Upham
commenced with an account of the stealing of his
pears by Oscar and Jerry, and the punishment which
followed that adventure. He said he had been threatened
with vengeance for causing the boys to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
whipped, and he had reason to believe that the burning
of his wood was the result of this grudge against him.</p>

<p>The witnesses were now brought forward. The first
was a boy, who testified that he heard Oscar say, with
an oath, that he would yet come up with Mr. Upham
for the flogging he gave him. A young man, who
worked on a farm, was then called up, and testified,
that whenever the pear-stealing scrape was mentioned
to Oscar, he would get mad, and threaten to be revenged
on Mr. Upham. The third witness was Clinton,
who testified, that one afternoon, a short time
before the fire, while he was at work mending a stone-wall
on his father’s land, near the scene of the conflagration,
Oscar and Jerry came along, and the former
asked several questions about the location of Mr. Upham’s
wood-lot, and particularly inquired if he owned
a certain lot of corded wood, which Oscar described,
and which was the same lot that was afterwards burnt.
The fourth and last witness, was a man who testified
that he was in the upper part of the town on the afternoon
of the fire, and, a short time before the alarm was
given, saw Oscar and Jerry, coming very fast from the
direction of Mr. Upham’s lot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>The Squire wrote down the testimony as it was
given. When it was concluded, he told Oscar he was
at liberty to make any remarks or produce any evidence
that he saw fit. Oscar, somewhat perplexed,
turned to his uncle, and after some conversation between
them, in a low tone, Mr. Preston remarked to
the Squire, that he thought the evidence against Oscar
was altogether too trivial to be worthy of serious notice.
There was not, he said, the least proof that Oscar
set the wood on fire. He thought Mr. Upham had
magnified a foolish, boyish threat into a matter of very
grave importance; and he expressed his opinion, very
decidedly, that the prisoner ought to be released
forthwith.</p>

<p>The Squire said he would defer his decision until
the other prisoner had been examined. Oscar was then
conducted from the room and Jerry was brought in.
He appeared even more pale and excited than his
cousin. The Squire addressed him in pretty much the
same strain of remark as he did Oscar; but before he
commenced reading the complaint, Jerry began to sob,
and with broken and choked utterance, said:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, I was there, and saw him do it, but I didn’t
have any hand in it myself.”</p>

<p>“That is right, my son,” said the Squire, in an encouraging
tone; “tell us all you know about it, just as
it happened, and it will be better for you than though
you attempted to deceive us. You say you ‘saw him
do it’—whom do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Oscar.”</p>

<p>“Well, go on with the story, and tell us all the particulars,” said
the Squire.</p>

<p>Jerry then related the history of the fire. Oscar, it
seemed, had formed the plan of burning the wood,
several days previous, and he regarded it as a sort of
joint operation, in which Jerry and he were to share
the fun, the gratification, and the risk. It appeared,
however, from Jerry’s story, that though he had entered
into the plan, he did not actually apply the
match, nor assist in the immediate preparations for the
fire. He was present rather as a spectator than an
actor.</p>

<p>When Jerry had finished his confession, Mr. Upham,
after a little conversation with the Squire, concluded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
to withdraw his complaint against Jerry.
Oscar was then re-called. He entered the room with
a calmer and more confident air than on the first occasion;
for since he had discovered how weak the testimony
against him was, he had little fear for the result.
When, however, Jerry was called to take the oath of
a witness, a deadly paleness came over the guilty boy,
and he almost fainted. This was quickly succeeded
by an expression of rage in his countenance, for Oscar
was a boy of strong passions, and when they were excited,
he could not conceal them. It was necessary
that Jerry should relate under oath, and before Oscar,
the account he had already given of the fire, for every
person charged with crime has a right to hear the evidence
against him. When he had done this, the
Squire asked Oscar if he had anything to say.</p>

<p>“No,” replied Oscar.</p>

<p>“Then,” added Squire Walcott, “I have only to say
that the evidence of your guilt looks very black, and
unless you can break down the testimony of Jerry, I
fear your conviction will be certain. I must bind you
over for trial, and shall require you to give bonds in
the sum of two hundred dollars, to appear before the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
county court at the next term. “Mr. Preston,” he
continued, “will you be his bondsman?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Mr. Preston, in a decided tone; “the
boy has been trouble enough to me, already, and now
he may go to jail, for all I care.” A moment after,
noticing the distressed look of his nephew, he somewhat
relented, in his feelings, and, in a milder tone,
assured Oscar that he would write immediately to his
father, who would doubtless hasten to his relief, and
settle the whole affair without any further trial.</p>

<p>The little court now broke up, and all returned to
their homes, save Oscar, who was still in the custody
of Mr. Merriam, the constable, in default of bail.
After making a few hasty arrangements for the journey,
the officer and prisoner set out for the county jail,
which was about fifteen miles distant. Mr. Merriam
had thought of putting a pair of hand-cuffs upon
Oscar, to prevent his escaping, during this long ride;
but the latter begged so hard to be spared this humiliation
that he relented, and allowed the boy to ride by
his side in the open wagon, free and untrammelled. He
also tried to divert his mind from his unpleasant situation,
by conversation on other subjects, but Oscar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
seemed little inclined to talk. His heart was full of
hard and bitter thoughts against every body, and especially
against Mr. Upham, Jerry, and his uncle.
He scarcely thought of his own guilt, so absorbed was
he in nursing his wrath against those whom he supposed
had injured him.</p>

<p>It was towards the middle of the afternoon, when
they arrived at the jail. A cold chill ran through
Oscar’s veins, for a moment, when he first caught sight
of his prison-house. Before, he could hardly realize
that he was a prisoner—it all seemed like a dream;
but here was the jail before him, with its stone walls
and grated windows, and the dream was changed to a
reality. Passing through a high gate, they entered that
part of the building occupied by the jailer’s family,
and were conducted to a room called “the office.” The
keeper of the jail soon made his appearance, and Mr.
Merriam informed him that Oscar was committed to
his custody for trial, and showed him the order from
Squire Walcott to that effect. The jailer asked several
questions about the case, and then took down a large
book, partly filled with writing, and made the following
entry within it:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>“<em>October 25th.</em>—Oscar Preston, of Brookdale, aged
14½ years, charged with setting fire to wood, in Brookdale.
Examined by Justice Walcott, and committed
for trial by Constable Merriam. Bail $200. Of ordinary
height for his age, slender form, light complexion,
brown hair, and blue eyes. Dress,—gray pantaloons,
dark blue jacket buttoned to chin, blue cloth cap.
Cell No. 19.”</p>

<p>The object of this brief description of the dress and
personal appearance of Oscar was, that he might be
the more easily identified, should he happen to escape
from the jail. Mr. Merriam, bidding a kind good-bye
to the young prisoner, now departed, and the jailer
proceeded to examine Oscar’s pockets, to see if there
was anything in them not allowed in the prison. The
only articles he took from them were two cigars, which
he tossed into the fire-place, telling Oscar he would
have no use for them there. He then conducted him
through a long and dark passage-way to cell No. 19,
which he had entered against his name in the registry-book,
and which was to be Oscar’s home for the present.
It was a small, narrow room, with one window,
near the top, which was guarded by iron bars. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
walls and floor were of brick (the former had been recently
white-washed) and the door was of iron. A
sort of bunk was fitted up in one corner of the cell,
which was supplied with bed-clothes. There were
also a small red pine table and an old chair, a basin,
bucket, tin dipper, and several other articles of furniture.</p>

<p>Oscar did not seem to be much pleased with the appearance
of his cell, and he said to the jailer:—</p>

<p>“Can’t you let me have a better room than this?
I shan’t stop here but a few days, and my father will
pay you for it, when he comes, if you will let me have
a good room.”</p>

<p>The jailer told him, in reply, that this was the most
comfortable vacant cell he had; that he did not wish
to put so young a prisoner in a cell with older offenders,
and if he was to stay but a few days, he could
easily make himself contented. After informing Oscar
of the principal rules and regulations of the prison,
the jailer locked the heavy door upon him, and retired.</p>

<p>The first impulse of the young criminal, in his solitude,
was to cry; but he soon checked himself, and resolved
to make the best of his situation. In a short<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
time his supper was brought to him, which consisted
of a few slices of
bread, and a dipper
of warm milk
and water. Before
night had
fully set in, Oscar
threw himself
upon the bunk,
and though it was
not so commodious
or so soft a
bed as he was accustomed
to, he
soon fell asleep, and dreamed over again the eventful
incidents of the day.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b084.jpg" alt="Oscar in Jail">
</figure>

<p>The result of Oscar’s trial created a great stir in
Brookdale. It was the principal topic of remark in
every family, and in every little knot of people that
happened to collect, for several days. The first mail
that left Brookdale, after the trial, carried a letter from
Mr. Preston to Oscar’s father in Boston, informing
him of the sad intelligence. In three or four days,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
the father of the unhappy boy arrived in Brookdale,
to see what could be done in behalf of his son. He first
sought an interview with Mr. Upham, who, after a
little persuasion, agreed to withdraw the complaint, if
his loss, $100, were made up to him. But to carry
out this arrangement, it was necessary to get the consent
of the prosecuting attorney of the county, who
now had charge of the case. The prosecuting attorney
is an officer appointed to represent the State at
the trials of criminals. Oscar having been bound over
for trial, the State became a party in the suit, in place
of Mr. Upham. The complaint now pending against
him, was endorsed, “<em>Commonwealth versus Oscar
Preston</em>.” The prosecuting attorney, as the representative
of the Commonwealth, can discontinue a suit, if
he deems the reasons sufficient. The agreement by
which this is done, is called a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nolle prosequi</i>, often abbreviated
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nol. pros.</i></p>

<p>Mr. Preston had to go to a neighboring town, some
dozen miles distant, to see the prosecuting attorney.
He laid before that officer the facts in the case, who,
after considering the matter, agreed to the proposition,
on condition that Oscar should leave the State forthwith.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
To this Mr. Preston consented; and on his
paying over to Mr. Upham, (who had accompanied
him on this visit,) the sum agreed upon, together with
all the other expenses of the suit, the prosecuting attorney
stayed further proceedings in the case, and gave
Mr. Preston an order for the release of his son from
jail.</p>

<p>Just one week after Oscar’s committal to the jail, his
father arrived, with the order of release. The interview
was not a very pleasant one. The father was
evidently deeply mortified and displeased; the son was
equally ashamed and embarrassed. But little was
said, however, on either side. Mr. Preston returned
to Boston as soon as possible, taking Oscar with him.</p>

<span class="fs80">JERRY AND CLINTON.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Soon</span> after Oscar left Brookdale, Jerry’s father,
who was interested in the logging business, started
for the head-waters of the Penobscot river, to be absent
several months. Large parties or gangs of loggers,
as they are called, encamp every winter in the
forests of Maine, for the purpose of cutting timber.
After the trees are chopped down, the logs are hauled
by oxen to the banks of some stream, where they remain
until the ice breaks up in the spring, when they
are rolled into the water, and floated down the swollen
river, to the mills. Such was the business which kept
Mr. Preston away from his home nearly half the
year.</p>

<p>Jerry’s conduct had never been very dutiful toward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
his mother, nor very affectionate toward his little sisters,
during his father’s long absences from home; but
now it was soon evident that he was going to give the
family much more trouble than ever before. He
obeyed his mother only when her commands happened
to be perfectly agreeable to him.</p>

<p>One day, Jerry’s little sister, Mary, came running
into, the house, saying:—</p>

<p>“O, mother, Jerry has got two beautiful little rabbits,
the cunningest little things you ever saw; and he
says they are his, and he’s going to make a house for
them out of the old grain-chest in the barn.”</p>

<p>“No, he wont,” said Mrs. Preston; “he shan’t keep
rabbits,—his father has forbidden it over and over
again. Go and tell him to come here this minute; I
want to see him.”</p>

<p>Mary ran out to the barn and told Jerry all that his
mother had said. He took no notice, however, of her
command, but kept at work upon the old chest, which
he was converting into a rabbit-house. Mrs. Preston
was busy about her work, and did not go out to the
barn to see what her son was about. In fact, she soon
forgot about the rabbits, and did not think of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
again until Jerry came in to supper. She then asked
him if he had brought some rabbits home.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mrs. Preston, “you had better carry
them off again just as quick as you can, or I shall get
James to kill them.” James was a young man who
lived on Mr. Preston’s farm.</p>

<p>“I should like to see Jim kill my rabbits,” replied
Jerry; “I guess it wouldn’t be healthy for him to do it.”</p>

<p>“But you know,” replied his mother, “that your
father has always refused to let you keep rabbits.
They may do a great deal of mischief, and are of no use
whatever. They’ll be a real trouble to you, too, and
you’ll soon get sick of them. Come, I wouldn’t keep
them. Send them off, and I will make it up to you in
something else.”</p>

<p>“What else?” inquired Jerry, who was always
ready to listen, when his mother proposed to “buy him
off” from doing anything she did not like.</p>

<p>“O, I don’t know now,” she replied; “you’ll want
something or other by-and-by, and if you send the
rabbits off, I shall probably let you have it.”</p>

<p>Jerry did not accept this rather indefinite offer, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
pretty soon the topic of conversation was changed.
The next day he completed the quarters for his rabbits,
in spite of the threats of James, and the feeble
remonstrances and coaxings of his mother. He kept
them shut up several days, that they might learn to
feel at home; after which, he left their door open, giving
them the run of the barn and garden.</p>

<p>The rabbits had enjoyed their liberty but three or
four days, when one morning James discovered, to his
astonishment, that they had completely stripped the
bark, as high up as they could reach, from about
thirty young apple and pear trees, which Mr. Preston
had set out two or three years previous. The excitement
which this discovery produced in the family was
so great as almost to make even Jerry tremble for a
while. The trees thus destroyed were choice varieties,
and it would require several years’ time, as well as
much care and money, to make good the loss. The
blame was, of course, thrown entirely upon Jerry, to
whom it belonged; and it was many days before he
heard the last of the scolding and fretting in consequence
of this mishap. As to the rabbits, he never
saw them again; and, as he made no inquiries, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>
never knew what fate befel them. James, in the heat
of his wrath, had despatched them both, without jury
or trial, on the morning when their depredations were
first discovered.</p>

<p>It was natural that Jerry should greatly miss Oscar,
with whom he had associated continually, day and
night, for several months. Indeed, he began to think
seriously of running away from home, and going to
Boston, that he might be with his cousin again, and
participate with him in some of the marvellous scenes
and adventures which Oscar had so often described. In
his lonesomeness, Jerry now began to seek the company
of Clinton more than ever. The district school
soon commenced for the season, and as both boys attended
it, they were thrown together much oftener than
in the summer months. In going to and from school,
Clinton had to pass Jerry’s house, and they usually
kept each other company by the way. For some reason
or other,—probably a suspicion that Clinton’s
parents did not like him very well,—Jerry seldom
went to Mr. Davenport’s house. Of course, Mr. Davenport
did not know that any particular intimacy existed
between his son and Jerry. He occasionally spoke of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
the latter as a boy whose end, he feared, would not be
good; and more than once he expressed a wish that
Clinton would avoid him as much as possible. But
this, Clinton found it rather difficult to do. Jerry
sought his company, and he could not bear to say no.
He knew Jerry was a bad boy, and that he did wrong
to put himself under his influence; but he had not sufficient
decision of character to terminate an acquaintance
which had been so long continued. So the intimacy
was kept up, to the great injury of Clinton.</p>

<p>At school, Jerry was not only a dull scholar, but a
very troublesome one. Having never been taught to
obey at home, he was rude and ungovernable in the
school-room, and was more frequently punished for disobedience
and inattention to his duties than any other
boy in the school. After the novelty had worn off,
Jerry began to grow tired of attending, and occasionally
played truant, always contriving, however, to escape
detection, by representing that he was detained at
home by his mother. But after a while these absences
grew so frequent, that the master began to suspect all
might not be right; and one morning, on calling Jerry
to account for his absence the preceding afternoon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
he told him he should not excuse him unless he brought
a note from his mother in the afternoon, certifying that
he was kept at home.</p>

<p>Jerry was put to his wit’s end, by this new and unexpected
demand. He had been off on a skating frolic
the afternoon previous, while his mother supposed him
to be at school, and he could not, therefore, ask her for
a note of excuse. What could he do? If he did not
bring an excuse in the afternoon, he was afraid the
matter would be investigated, and lead to the discovery
of his other frequent truancies; and in this case, he
knew he would not escape a severe punishment. At
first he thought of writing a note himself, and signing
his mother’s name to it; but then he wrote such an
awkward hand, and was such a poor speller, that he
was afraid he could not deceive the teacher. After
thinking the matter over, all the forenoon, he at last
resolved to do one of two things,—either to persuade
some one to write the excuse for him, or else never to
enter the school-room again.</p>

<p>When school was dismissed, Jerry walked home
with Clinton, as usual. After they had got beyond the
hearing of the other scholars, Jerry said:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span></p>

<p>“Clinty, I’ve got into a bad scrape, and I don’t
know how to get out of it, unless you help me.”</p>

<p>“How can I?” inquired Clinton, who at once comprehended
the situation of affairs.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you of a plan I’ve thought of,” continued
Jerry; “and if you’ll only say yes, I guess we can fix
it easy enough. You see it wont do for me to ask the
old woman for a note,”—<em>the old woman</em> was the disrespectful
title by which he usually spoke of his mother,—“and
if I go to school without one, I’m afraid that
old Eaton will find out that I’ve been playing truant
all along, and he’ll give me a regular trouncing. Now
if <em>you</em> will write the note, nobody will ever know the
difference, for you can write just like a woman. I
would do it myself, if I could write as well as you can.”</p>

<p>“What!” said Clinton, with some signs of astonishment;
“you don’t mean that you want me to write
an excuse, and sign your mother’s name to it, do
you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s it, exactly; unless you can tell me of
a better way to get out of my trouble.”</p>

<p>“I should like to help you out of it,” replied Clinton;
“but I couldn’t do that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span></p>

<p>“Then,” added Jerry, in a decided tone, “I shall
never see the inside of the old school-house again. I
don’t know of anybody else that I can get to write the
note, and I am not going there without it, to have the
breath beat out of my body. I shall go to Boston, and
take my chance,—I wont stay about here any longer.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk so,” said Clinton. “Why not tell your
mother that you didn’t go to school yesterday afternoon,
and ask her to write an excuse? She would
do it, I guess, if you made the confession, rather than
have you punished.”</p>

<p>“She do it!” exclaimed Jerry, with some bitterness;
“no, more likely she would write a note requesting old
Eaton to lick me like blazes. But,” he continued,
“why wont you write the excuse, Clinty?”</p>

<p>Clinton hesitated what reply to make to this question.
If he had honestly confessed his feelings, he
would have said, “It would be wrong, very wrong, to
do such a thing;” for his conscience told him this, and
this alone was the objection that weighed in his mind.
And yet Clinton, though a well-trained and virtuous
boy, had a foolish dread of confessing that he was
afraid to do a wrong act. This was especially the case<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
in his intercourse with Jerry, who, he knew, seldom
had scruples of this kind, and whose ridicule he
dreaded more than that of his other associates. So,
after a brief pause, he said,</p>

<p>“Why, there would be a great risk in doing that.
If Master Eaton should discover that I wrote the excuse,
it would be a bad piece of business for both of
us.”</p>

<p>“But <em>how</em> can he find it out? He doesn’t know
my mother’s hand-writing, and if you write it neat and
fine, he wont suspect anything. Come, you write it
when you get home, and bring it with you this afternoon,
and I’ll meet you on the road. If you don’t I
shan’t go to school, that’s all.”</p>

<p>By this time they had reached Mr. Preston’s house,
and after a few more words of coaxing and entreaty,
Jerry left his friend, with a pretty confident feeling
that he would accede to his wishes. True, Clinton
did not actually promise to write the note; but Jerry
knew how difficult it was for him to say no, to any
pressing suitor, and he felt almost sure that his wicked
plan would be successful.</p>

<p>When Clinton was left to his own thoughts, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>
came on a severe struggle in his mind. He could not
bear the idea of lending himself to such a mean and
wicked piece of deception, and yet he feared to meet
Jerry with a refusal. He thought, also, what the consequences
would be to himself, should the fraud be discovered.
And then he thought of Jerry’s threat to
leave school and run away from home, if he did not
write the excuse. If he could prevent this great sin
on the part of Jerry, might it not atone in a measure
for the lesser sin of writing the note? This question
arose in his mind, and many an older head has been
led astray by a similar suggestion. No, Clinton, you
must not do evil that good may come, or greater evil be
prevented. You must not commit a sin, even in kindness
to a friend. But he did not hear the voice, and
when he reached his home, he was as undecided as
ever what to do.</p>

<p>Clinton’s long walk to and from school, left him little
more than time enough to eat his dinner. The noon
meal not being quite ready, when he entered the house,
he went to his father’s desk, and began to scribble
something in the form of a note of excuse. After
writing several, to see how they would look, he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
called to dinner; and hastily selecting the best looking
of the notes, he put it in his pocket, for future consideration,
and destroyed the others. Even now, he was
no nearer a decision than he was at first.</p>

<p>When Clinton arose from the dinner-table, it was
time to start for school. He had not proceeded far
before he overtook Jerry, who was loitering along, in
expectation of his approach.</p>

<p>“I’ll take that note now,” said Jerry, stretching out
his hand to Clinton, as the latter came up with him.</p>

<p>“I don’t know about that,” said Clinton; “I’ve
been thinking it all over, and have about come to the
conclusion that I can’t agree to your proposal. But
haven’t you thought of some other way to get out of
the scrape?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Jerry, “there is no other way; but
you have written the note, haven’t you?” he added,
with some appearance of alarm.</p>

<p>“I have written something,” replied Clinton, “just
to see how it would seem; but I rather guess I shan’t
let you have it.”</p>

<p>“Let me look at it, then, wont you?”</p>

<p>“I guess so!” said Clinton, with a laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>“But I’m in earnest,” added Jerry, “just let me look
at it, and I can tell in a minute whether it will answer.
Perhaps it wont do, and then I shan’t want it,
at any rate. Come, let me see it, and if you don’t
want me to keep it, I wont.”</p>

<p>Clinton took the excuse from his pocket, and
allowed Jerry to look at it. It read as follows;—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“Mr. Eaton will please excuse Jerry for absence from school,
yesterday, as he was needed at home.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Eliza Preston.</span></p>
<p class="no-indent">
<em>Jan. 5th.</em>”<br>
</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>After reading the note, Jerry said it would do first
rate; but instead of returning it to Clinton, as he
promised, he put it into his own pocket. Clinton reminded
him of his promise, and tried to get the paper
back again, but in vain; and Jerry carried on the contest
in such a good-natured, bantering spirit, that
Clinton could not take offence. Thus the deed was
done, so far as Clinton was concerned, without his
coming to any decision about it. In such cases as this,
no decision at all, is often equivalent to a wrong
decision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span></p>

<p>As Jerry entered the school-room, that afternoon,
he handed the forged note to Master Eaton, who read
it, and, without saying anything, tore it up. The deception
was successful.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">My</span> young friend, did you ever master a hard lesson,
after a great effort? And do you remember how
you felt, after the achievement? Perhaps it was a
difficult sum; and when you began, you did not see
how you could possibly work your way through it.
But you persevered, and covered your slate with long
columns of figures, until at length you arrived at the
correct answer, and you felt something like the philosopher
of old, who exclaimed, after solving a difficulty,
<em>Eureka</em>,—I have found it! And now, having conquered
this sum, you felt just like attacking a still
harder one, the next day. You <em>knew</em> you could do it,
because you did the other; and you took hold of it,
with a determination to work it out—and you <em>did</em>
work it out, did you not?</p>

<p>Perhaps there was another boy in your class, who attempted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
to do the same thing. But before he had put
forth half the effort required, he got tired of the sum,
and gave up the attempt. The next day the teacher
tried to encourage him to make another attempt, but
the boy <em>knew</em> he could not do the sum,—he had tried
once, and it was of no use to try again. So the teacher
was obliged to turn him back into simple addition and
multiplication, and he will probably never get much
beyond those departments of arithmetic.</p>

<p>It is precisely the same with everything else that
we attempt to do. Suppose, instead of a difficult sum,
it was a fault, or temptation, that these two lads tried to
master. One of them persevered until he conquered
the difficulty, and the result was, his virtuous principles
were strengthened, and he was prepared to resist still
greater temptations, or to subdue greater faults. His
motto is, “<em>I can</em>.” The other boy would not make the
necessary effort, and gave up the attempt after a poor,
feeble trial. The consequence was, he not only fell into
bad habits, but lost his self-reliance, by degrees, until
the notion got into his head that it was of no use
for him to try to do right. “<em>I can’t</em>” is his motto.</p>

<p>The lesson to be drawn from this is a very important<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>
one, as you will see from the history of Clinton. That
you may have a clear idea of it, let me state it thus:—</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Every temptation resisted, will give you
greater confidence in your ability to overcome
new temptations. Every temptation
yielded to, will impair your self-reliance,
and prepare the way for yet greater
faults.</span></p>

<p>Clinton soon found that he had made a great mistake,
in aiding Jerry to escape the consequences of his
truancy. True, the deception was not discovered; but
the very success of the plan encouraged Jerry to repeat
the experiment, and Clinton now found it less
easy to refuse to write an excuse than at first. His sin
was, therefore, repeated again and again, until Jerry
felt at perfect liberty to absent himself as often as he
pleased, knowing that Clinton would furnish him with
the written excuse, which the teacher now required in
all cases of absence. To be sure, Clinton objected,
and scolded, and threatened; but Jerry cared little for
this, so long as he was sure to yield to his desires in
the end. If ever a more convincing argument than
usual was needed, the hard-hearted boy would secure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
his end by hinting at an exposure of Clinton’s-share in
his past truancies. Thus did Clinton find himself
fast in the net of this bad associate; and thus, through
the influence of one false step, did he continue to do
wrong, against his conscience, and even against his own
wishes.</p>

<p>The people of Brookdale frequently held social parties,
at their houses, in the long winter evenings, which
were usually attended by all the neighborhood. They
were not favorably situated for maintaining the lectures
and other entertainments which are common in
large towns, and these social gatherings were a substitute
for them. At one of these parties, Mrs. Preston
happened to meet Master Eaton, and after a few words
on unimportant matters, she inquired how Jerry got
along at school. Mr. Eaton could not give a very favorable
report either of Jerry’s behavior or scholarship.
He did not wish to pain Mrs. Preston, at such a
time, by telling her exactly how things stood; and so
he thought he would evade a direct reply to her question,
by turning her attention to a point where he supposed
she herself was at fault.</p>

<p>“Why,” he remarked, “he is absent so often that it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
is hard to tell whether he really does make any progress.
I find that scholars never get along very well
unless they are pretty regular in their attendance.”</p>

<p>“But what do you mean?” inquired Mrs. Preston;
“I thought he attended school regularly.”</p>

<p>“O,” replied Mr. Eaton, “parents are hardly ever
conscious of the bad effects of absences upon the
scholar. They think it of little consequence if their
children are kept at home two or three times a week,
but it is just this little irregularity in attendance that
often prevents their learning anything.”</p>

<p>“But you are mistaken, Mr. Eaton,” said Mrs.
Preston; “I have not kept Jerry at home half a day
this winter.”</p>

<p>“He always brings an excuse from you, when absent,”
added Mr. Eaton.</p>

<p>“An excuse from me!” said Mrs. Preston, with an
air of astonishment; “why, I have not written an excuse
for him this term, and I did not know that he had
ever been absent.”</p>

<p>Master Eaton was now as much astonished as was
Mrs. Preston. Both had made an unpleasant discovery.
It was evident that Jerry was a worse boy than either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
of them had supposed. He had played the rogue with
a high hand. After some further conversation, it was
agreed that Mrs. Preston should say nothing at present
respecting Jerry’s misconduct, but leave the teacher to
investigate the affair.</p>

<p>The next morning, on searching his desk, Master
Eaton found several of Jerry’s old notes of excuse,
which had been accepted, and thrown aside. His first
object was to find out who wrote them, for he knew
that Jerry could not have done it. At first, he thought
the writing was the work of a female hand; but
among the girls who attended school, there was not
one whom he could suspect of such conduct. Besides,
he knew that Jerry was not very popular, with the
girls, who regarded him as a rude, rough boy, and
shunned his company as much as possible. He then
took the writing-books of the male scholars, and examined
each one carefully, by itself, comparing the
penmanship with that of the notes. The conclusion
to which he came was, that there were only three
male scholars who could possibly have written the
notes. Two of these were young men, nearly grown
up, who apparently held very little intercourse with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
Jerry; the other was Clinton, an intimate acquaintance
of Jerry, but a boy whose conduct at school had
always been unexceptionable. Surely, none of these
could have had a hand in the mischief. At least, so
thought Master Eaton.</p>

<p>Several days elapsed, and the teacher made no progress
in his investigations. At last, Jerry’s seat was
vacant, for one entire day, for he now seldom took less
than a day at a time, when he played truant. The
next morning, he appeared with a note, as usual, which
the master read, and put in his desk, without making
any remark. Mr. Eaton had noticed that Clinton and
Jerry came to school together, that morning, and as he
glanced at Clinton, after reading the note, he observed
that the latter turned his eye quickly away, and dropped
his head, as if afraid to meet the gaze of his
teacher. This led Mr. Eaton to watch him more
closely, and it was with the deepest pain that he detected
an uneasy, anxious appearance in his manners,
which he had never before observed. In the course
of the forenoon, he stopped a few moments at Clinton’s
seat, and conversed familiarly with him about his
lessons; but there was a constraint and want of frankness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
in the boy’s appearance that only served to deepen
the master’s painful suspicion.</p>

<p>The truth was, Clinton went to school, that morning,
with a vague foreboding that his guilt was about to be
brought to light. By some mysterious process, which
I cannot explain, a secret impression of approaching
evil sometimes weighs heavily upon the mind, without
any known cause. This was the case with Clinton,
that morning, and the glance which his teacher cast
toward him, after reading Jerry’s excuse, sent the conviction
to his heart that he was discovered. How
easily does guilt betray itself!</p>

<p>School was dismissed as usual, at noon, and again
assembled in the afternoon. The master had intended
to detain Clinton after school in the forenoon; but the
intermission was so short, that he concluded to defer
the investigation until afternoon. Just before dismissing
the scholars, at night, he went to Clinton’s seat,
and in a low tone of voice which no one else heard,
requested him to remain after school. Clinton turned
red, and then pale, at this unusual request, made in so
unusual a manner. After the scholars had all passed
out, and the doors were shut, Mr. Eaton called Clinton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
up to his desk, and taking Jerry’s excuse from the
drawer, held it up, and asked him if he knew anything
about it.</p>

<p>It was a terrible moment for the unhappy boy. He
felt that his guilt had already betrayed itself, and exposure,
shame, and punishment were now inevitable.
His tongue refused to speak, and after vainly struggling
with his emotions a few moments, his pent-up
feelings found an outlet in an outburst of tears. His
legs trembled beneath him; and throwing himself upon
a bench near by, he buried his face in his hands
and sobbed bitterly.</p>

<p>Mr. Eaton did not repeat his question—it was already
answered. He saw, however, that there was
penitence as well as guilt, in the youth before him, and
when he spoke to him, it was in a kind and soothing
tone. “Clinton,” he said, “I have kept school here
three winters, and this is the first time I have ever
had to call you to account for a fault. You have always
behaved well; if you have done wrong now, I
think you must have been led astray by some great
temptation. I accidentally discovered, a few days
ago, that these notes did not come from Jerry’s mother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
and I determined to trace them to their source. I
judge from your conduct that you wrote them. If so,
I want you to make a clean confession of the affair.
If you have really had a hand in this matter, you
should consider yourself fortunate that you have been
detected, before it went any farther. I have long
known Jerry Preston to be a very bad boy, but you
are so unlike him that I did not suspect he was leading
you on to ruin. Come, wipe your eyes, and tell
me the whole history of this matter.”</p>

<p>“Will you promise me one thing?” said Clinton,
speaking with considerable difficulty amid his sobs and
tears.</p>

<p>“I cannot promise you anything until I know what
it is,” replied Mr. Eaton. “What is the promise you
refer to?”</p>

<p>“I am willing to tell <em>you</em> the whole story,” added
Clinton, “but I don’t want any body else to hear of
it.”</p>

<p>“I cannot promise you that,” remarked Mr. Eaton,
“for there may be good reasons why the affair should
not be kept secret. I will agree, however, to keep it
private, provided I think I can properly do so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span></p>

<p>Clinton now proceeded to relate all the circumstances
connected with the forged excuses, just as they
occurred. He described his fears, his struggles with
conscience, the threats of Jerry to run away, and the
artifice by which the latter obtained possession of the
first note. Nothing was kept back, and as Mr. Eaton
listened to the disclosures thus frankly made, and read
the sorrow and repentance of Clinton in his looks and
tones, he was satisfied that a true account had been
given. Clinton himself felt as though a terrible burden
had been rolled from his heart, after he had concluded
his confession. He breathed freer than he had for
several days previous.</p>

<p>After Clinton had concluded his confession, Master
Eaton sat in silence several moments, apparently engaged
in deep thought. At length he spoke:—</p>

<p>“This is sad business, Clinton,—sad business. You
have been guilty of a series of forgeries, in repeatedly
signing another person’s name. You have also aided
and encouraged a bad boy in his evil ways, and are to
some extent responsible for his wickedness.”</p>

<p>Clinton commenced crying afresh.</p>

<p>“But,” continued the teacher, “there are some extenuating<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
circumstances in the case, which I shall take
into consideration. I cannot see as a public exposure
of your wrong-doing before the school would be of any
benefit to yourself or to others, and I shall spare you
that mortification, provided your general conduct continues
good. And as to the punishment that the case
demands, I will consult with your father before concluding
upon it.”</p>

<p>“O no,” exclaimed Clinton, “don’t tell <em>him</em> about
it. Punish me in any way you please, and I’ll promise
never to offend again, if you wont let father know
anything about it.”</p>

<p>Mr. Eaton’s reply was decided, but kindly expressed.
“Clinton,” he said, “I have always considered you a
youth of good habits, but the disclosures you have
just made show that your character has a weak side.
You are too easily influenced by others. You can’t
say <em>no</em>, when a great temptation presents itself. In
my opinion, you have just had a narrow escape from
ruin; for who can tell into what evil Jerry would
have soon led you, if the spell had not been accidentally
broken? Now your father is ignorant of all
this. He has no idea, probably, of the dangers to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
which you are exposed; but he ought to know the
facts in the case, and I should not feel as though I
had been faithful to my trust, were I to hush up a
matter of so great importance to his and your welfare.
No, I cannot think of doing it. The better way
would be for you to go to him and confess the whole
truth, yourself. If you are really sorry for what you
have done, as I suppose you are, you ought to be
willing to do this. What do you say to the proposal?”</p>

<p>“If you think I ought to, I will do it,” replied
Clinton, somewhat reluctantly; “but I would rather
he would not know it.”</p>

<p>“My advice is,” said Mr. Eaton, “that you go home
and confess the whole affair to your father to night.
If you do so, I shall consider that my duty has been
discharged, so far as you are concerned; and shall
leave the matter of punishment entirely with your
father.”</p>

<p>With these words Mr. Eaton bade his pupil good-night,
and both departed for their homes. On his
way home, Clinton encountered Jerry, who, suspecting
the cause of his detention, had loitered on the road,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
waiting to learn the truth. Clinton told him they were
discovered, but declined giving him any information,
or entering into any farther conversation on the subject;
and he hurried home, leaving Jerry not a little
perplexed at his unusual conduct.</p>

<span class="fs80">CONFESSION.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">While</span> Clinton is on his way home from school,
after the discovery of his offence, let us look in a
moment upon his parents.</p>

<p>“After six o’clock, and Clinton has not made his appearance
yet,” said Mrs. Davenport, who had the
smoking tea and toasted bread upon the table, in readiness
for the evening meal. “Really, husband, I begin
to feel uneasy about Clinton. He is away from home
a great deal more than he used to be, and when he is
here, he seems like a different boy from what he was
a year or two ago. You say you don’t notice anything
unusual about him, but that only shows that a
mother’s eye is more quick to read the heart than a
man’s. <em>I</em> see a change in his conduct. He is more reserved
than he used to be; is less affectionate in his
manners, takes less interest in his work and books,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
and often seems absent-minded, as though he was
thinking of something that he meant to conceal from
us. I don’t like that Jerry Preston, and I’m afraid
he is doing Clinton no good.”</p>

<p>“You are only borrowing trouble when there is no
need of it,” replied Mr. Davenport. “I don’t see but
that Clinton behaves as well now as he ever did. At
any rate, I’ve no fault to find with his conduct, and
nobody else has yet made any complaint against him.
You must not expect that he will always be precisely
the same little boy he used to be. As he grows older,
he will naturally change, like all the rest of us.”</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="i_b117" style="max-width: 60.1875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b117.jpg" alt="Clinton at the fire-side">
</figure>
<br>

<p>Before Mrs. Davenport could reply, Clinton entered
the room, and silently took his seat with the family at
the supper-table. The conversation that had just
passed, naturally led both his parents to observe him
more closely than usual. Mr. Davenport thought he
looked unusually sober. But the mother, with her
penetrating eye, saw more than this; she saw traces
of weeping, and a peculiar expression of trouble, on
the face of Clinton. She noticed, also, that she could
not catch his eye, which was restless and uneasy. He
took no part in the conversation at the table, and ate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
but little. After tea, he took the lantern, and brought
in from the barn the usual supply of wood and kindling
stuff for the morrow, which was a part of his regular
work. This duty over, he seated himself on a cricket
by the fire-side, and commenced whittling a piece of
pine which he had brought in. Annie had been put to
bed, and his father and mother were seated at the light-stand,
which was drawn up in front of the blazing wood-fire.
The same troubled look which Mrs. Davenport
had noticed at the tea-table, was still very plainly visible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
on Clinton’s face. Indeed, he had seated himself
with the determination not to rise until he had made
his confession to both his parents; and he was thinking
how he should introduce the unpleasant topic, when his
father broke the silence by asking:—</p>

<p>“Clinton, what are you making?”</p>

<p>“I am only whittling,” he replied.</p>

<p>“I see you are whittling,” remarked Mr. Davenport;
“I inquired what you was making.”</p>

<p>“I aint making anything,” replied Clinton.</p>

<p>“That’s a bad sign, Clinty,” continued his father.
“I know whittling is a Yankee accomplishment, but he
is a poor Yankee, who whittles away his stick to
nothing. Did you never hear of the fellow who lost
his sweet-heart by doing that very thing?”</p>

<p>Clinton shook his head, in the negative.</p>

<p>“Well,” continued Mr. Davenport, “after the young
man had come to an understanding with the pretty
lass whom he intended to make his wife, he had to go
to her father to get his consent to the arrangement.
The father was a shrewd old farmer, and he noticed
that his daughter’s suitor, during the awkward interview,
whittled away very industriously at a stick, just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
as you were doing a moment ago. The old man
watched the movement of the knife, and at the same
time continued to talk on the prospects of his would-be
son-in-law, until the stick had dwindled down to nothing.
Then he said to the young man: ‘Sir, you have property,
and steady habits, and are good-looking; but you
can’t have my daughter. Had you made something,—no
matter what,—of the stick you have whittled
away, you could have had her; as it is,—you cannot.
Your property will go as the stick did, little by little,
until all is gone, and your family reduced to want. I
have read your true character; you have my answer.’</p>

<p>“So,” continued Mr. Davenport, “you see what a
man lost by whittling his stick away to nothing. Perhaps
he only did it because he had something on his
mind, which he did not know how to get off; but he
took a very foolish way to get over the difficulty, as he
soon discovered.”</p>

<p>This last remark, whether intended so by his father
or not, Clinton took as having a special meaning for
him. He thought it an evidence that his father had
noticed his troubled look, and was awaiting an explanation.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
So throwing his piece of pine into the fire, and
summoning all his resolution, he said, as his eyes filled
with tears:—</p>

<p>“Father, I <em>have</em> got something on my mind that has
made me very unhappy for a good while, and now I
want to tell you all about it.”</p>

<p>At these words his mother, who was sewing, dropped
her work and fixed her eyes earnestly upon Clinton.
His father, forgetting his conversation an hour or two
previous with Mrs. Davenport, said:—</p>

<p>“I thought something ailed you, Clinton, and I am
glad you have concluded to tell us about it. You have
no better friends than your father and mother, and you
ought never to conceal your troubles from them. Go
on with your story.”</p>

<p>Clinton then made a full and frank confession of his
misdoing, as it has been already related. He also gave
an account of the manner in which he had been detected,
so far as he had been able to learn, and narrated
the conversation he had held with Master Eaton, that
afternoon. When he concluded his confession, his parents,
as well as himself, were in tears. For some moments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
there was a silence, unbroken save by sobs. Mr.
Davenport then arose, and pressing Clinton to his
heart, said:—</p>

<p>“My son, I bless God that he has given you courage
to make this confession. You have done very wrong;
you have had a narrow escape from shipwreck,—and
all the while <em>we</em> were not dreaming of your danger!
O, how could you deceive us so? But I won’t chide
you now. You have done well to disclose it all, even
at this late day,—and I hope you have learned a
lesson from this affair which you will never forget!”</p>

<p>His father and mother continued the conversation for
some time,—pointing out to Clinton, very plainly but
kindly, the principal faults of his character, by which
he had been led astray; and warning him earnestly
against associating any more with Jerry, or any other
boys of his stamp. At length, Mr. Davenport inquired
what punishment the teacher had inflicted.</p>

<p>“None,” replied Clinton; “he said, if I would confess
the whole affair to you, he would leave the punishment
to you.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said his father, “I will think about it. I could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
cheerfully forgive all the past, if you would promise to
do better hereafter,—but I am not sure that this
would be the best thing for you.”</p>

<p>“I mean to behave better hereafter,” said Clinton;
“but I do not ask to be pardoned without punishment.
I know I deserve to suffer for my conduct, and I shan’t
think hard of it if I do.”</p>

<p>Mr. Davenport said he would consider the matter,
and announce his decision the next day. The family
then knelt in prayer; and the erring, but repentant, son
was most affectionately commended to the Divine forgiveness,
and the Good Spirit implored to guide his
future steps.</p>

<p>The next morning Clinton attended school, as usual,
but Jerry was absent. Mr. Eaton inquired of Clinton
if he had kept his promise, and seemed much pleased
when he answered in the affirmative. He gave him
some good advice, and expressed the hope that he
would avoid all similar errors hereafter. It being
Saturday, no school was held in the afternoon, and
Clinton returned home without having seen Jerry.</p>

<p>In the evening, when Clinton was alone with his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
parents, the subject which had engrossed the thoughts
of all, so earnestly, for the last twenty-four hours, was
again introduced.</p>

<p>“Your mother and I,” said Mr. Davenport, “have
talked over your affair, Clinton, and we have come to
the conclusion that the series of offences was so long,
and so aggravated, that the pain of exposure which
you have suffered is hardly sufficient punishment.
You did well in making a confession, it is true; but, you
did not do that, until you found you could no longer
conceal your guilt. We have therefore decided that
you must forego your promised trip to Boston next
March, by way of punishment.”</p>

<p>This was, indeed, a severe deprivation to Clinton.
For more than six months he had been anticipating,
with delight, the arrival of spring, when, the winter-school
over, he was to spend several weeks with his
uncle and cousins in Boston. But he felt that the disappointment
was deserved, and he made no complaint.
His father afterwards added, for his encouragement,
that if his conduct continued unexceptionable, the suspended
visit should come off in the following autumn,
after the fall work was over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding his disappointment, Clinton went to
bed that night with a lighter heart than he had known
before for many weeks. He felt that he had escaped
from a frightful snare, and that he could once more
look his parents and teacher honestly in the face. He
determined to retrieve, by his good conduct, whatever
he had lost, in their estimation; and he felt almost impatient
to be tempted again, that he might show them
how firmly he could now resist every evil influence.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE RUNAWAY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Early</span> on the Monday morning after the events
related in the preceding chapter, Mrs. Preston was
seen approaching the house of Mr. Davenport. She
was evidently much excited and troubled, and as soon
as she entered the room, she proceeded to disclose her
errand. It was simply this, Jerry had run away from
home!</p>

<p>It will be remembered that Jerry learned from Clinton
on Friday evening, that his truancies were discovered.
He had already made up his mind what to do
in case of such an emergency; and the following day
he thought the matter over, and determined how to
proceed. The next day all the family went to church
but himself, he having desired permission to stay at
home and take care of the house. After he was left
alone, he hastily dressed himself in his best suit, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
proceeded to tie up in a bundle a few articles of
clothing, such as shirts, stockings, etc. He then went
to his mother’s bureau, and, knowing where she kept
the key, unlocked a drawer, and took therefrom a
purse containing all the money she then had on hand,
amounting to about thirty dollars. Seeing some letter
paper by the side of the purse, he wrote the following
message on the sheet, and left it in the drawer:—</p>

<div class="blockquot fs90">

<p>“i am tyred of staing in this misrable plaice—i am Goeing
to see, and you wont se me again verry soon. you se i took a
feu dollars, to help me allong—you musnt think you can
ketch me, so Goodbie.”</p>
</div>

<p>Having thus fitted himself out for the journey, Jerry
turned his back upon his home, without one reluctant
thought, and hastened on his way toward Boston. As
the family did not return from church until the afternoon
service was over, no one knew of the disappearance
of Jerry till late in the day. At first, nothing
strange was thought of his absence; but when night
set in, and he did not appear, his mother began to
grow uneasy. On examining the chest in his bed-room,
she found that some of his clean clothes had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
gone, and a suspicion flashed upon her mind that he
had forsaken his home. Still later in the evening, she
happened to go to her drawer, and discovered Jerry’s
farewell note, and—the robbery. Yes, her son was
a thief, as well as a runaway. I will not attempt to
describe the anguish which pierced her soul, when she
read his heartless message, confirming her worst suspicions.
Bad and unruly though he was, he was her
own, her only son, and she still loved him with the
affection which only a mother can know. And now to
be separated from her boy under such painful and
mortifying circumstances—to lose all influence over
him, and all knowledge, even, of his whereabouts, with
the prospect of never seeing him again—ah, it cost
her a pang such as she never before experienced.</p>

<p>Mrs. Preston destroyed Jerry’s letter, before any one
else could have a chance to see it; for she determined
that no one, even in the family, should know of the
theft he committed. Of course, she said nothing to
Mr. Davenport about this. She called upon him to
ask his advice and aid in the matter. Mr. Davenport
was not much surprised to hear that Jerry had run<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span>
away. From what he knew of the boy, it was only
what might have been expected. Nor, on the whole,
was he very sorry that he had gone; for he was a bad
boy, and was corrupting the youth of the village, and
his leaving the place would be a public blessing. Still,
Mr. Davenport could not help pitying Jerry’s mother,
and in spite of his feelings, he thought it his duty to
assist her to recover her son, or at least to ascertain
where he had gone. He therefore advised her to
write immediately to Jerry’s uncle in Boston, and request
him to put the police officers on the look-out for
the runaway, should he show himself in that city. He
also decided to go himself in pursuit of Jerry, in a
sleigh, with the hope of overtaking him. But before
Mrs. Preston took her leave, he said to her:—</p>

<p>“I have one more word of advice, Mrs. Preston;
and that is, if Jerry is bent on going to sea, I think
you had better let him go a short voyage. If we
succeed in bringing him back, it is not likely that he
will stay here long; and if he is determined to go
away, he had better go with your knowledge and consent,
than without them. His uncle can probably secure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</span>
a chance for him on board some vessel where he
will be well treated, and then you will know where he
is, and be likely to hear from him occasionally.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Preston said that, for her part, she would
agree to such an arrangement, though she did not
know as Jerry’s father would consent to it.</p>

<p>Mr. Davenport kept his promise, and, as soon as he
could get ready, started off in pursuit of the runaway,
taking the road that led toward Portland. He stopped
occasionally at some house, on the road, to inquire if a
boy had been seen travelling that way the day before.
For a while, he could find no trace of Jerry; but at
last he found one house, the inmates of which remembered
that a lad, answering to the appearance of
Jerry, had passed along the road on foot, the day previous.
Mr. Davenport now pressed forward, subsequent
inquiries confirming him that he was on the right
track. Toward noon, he reached a village from which
a line of coaches ran to Waterville, connecting with
the railroad to Portland. On making inquiries at the
tavern, he learned that Jerry arrived there the evening
previous, and took the stage early in the morning, saying
that he was bound for Boston. It was, of course,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
useless for Mr. Davenport to follow him any farther,
and he accordingly returned home, and reported the
result of his inquiries.</p>

<p>“Father,” said Clinton, as the family sat around the
fire-side in the evening, “I shouldn’t think you would
be sorry Jerry has run away—and yet you’ve tried
pretty hard to catch him.”</p>

<p>“On some accounts,” replied Mr. Davenport, “I am
not sorry; but I pity his poor mother, and for her sake
I would like to save the boy from the foolish course he
has taken. But I have little faith that he would remain
here a great while, if brought back. He has
been permitted to have his own way so long, that
there is little probability of his submitting now to the
authority of his mother.”</p>

<p>“Well, I am almost sorry that he has gone, too,”
said Clinton.</p>

<p>“You ought not to be,” replied his father.</p>

<p>“Why, as to that,” said Clinton, “I had made up
my mind just how I would treat him, hereafter, and I
wanted you to see that I have got some firmness left;
but now I shan’t have any opportunity to show you
what I can do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>

<p>“You need not feel any regret on that score,” replied
Mr. Davenport. “It is easy enough to form good resolutions,
but perhaps it will be fortunate for you if
yours are never put to a severe test. But even if
Jerry does not return, I suspect you will meet with
temptations sufficient to prove your strength of resistance.
A wise man never courts temptation.”</p>

<span class="fs80">THE JOURNEY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Jerry</span> had planned his flight with considerable
care and skill, for a boy of his age; and before the
time came for him to take the first step, he had laid
out the course he intended to pursue. Dressed in his
best suit, with his bundle of clean clothes under his
arm, and with the ill-gotten thirty dollars stowed away
in the lower corner of his vest pocket, he started on
his journey into the great unknown world. He walked
for many a weary mile, over a road covered with snow
that had recently fallen; but the sun shone pleasantly,
and the weather was not so cold but that he sweat
very freely from his exercise. It was not until after
sunset that he reached the tavern where he proposed
to spend the night. This tavern was a large wooden
building, somewhat dingy with age, and bore upon its
front a faded, weather-beaten sign, on which was inscribed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
the name of its proprietor. Some time before
Jerry reached the building, he could see the bright,
cheerful light of the fire shining through the windows,
and flickering and flashing over the wide, level field of
snow which separated him from its comfortable shelter.
Quickening his steps, he was soon at the door, and
without stopping to knock, he entered the room from
which he had seen the light.</p>

<p>It was a large room, with sanded floor, and the walls
were covered with dingy maps, pictures, stage and
railroad bills, advertisements of public houses in other
places, and various other things. There was a large,
open fire-place on one side, and a heap of glowing
coals and blazing logs gave the room a very comfortable
and attractive aspect. Several men were
seated around the fire, in chairs, which supported
themselves on their back legs, at an angle of forty-five
degrees. Two or three of the company were smoking
cigars, the fumes of which filled the room almost to
suffocation. As Jerry entered, the men all seemed to
look at him pretty sharply, and as he laid down his
bundle, and drew a chair up to the fire, one of them
said,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span></p>

<p>“Well, young man, what can we do for you?”</p>

<p>“I want to stay here to-night,” replied Jerry,
“and I should like some supper too, if it isn’t too
late.”</p>

<p>“How far have you come to-day?” inquired the
man.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered Jerry; “I should think
it was about eighteen miles.”</p>

<p>“Running away from home, eh?” continued the inquirer.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not running away, but my mother has
sent me to Boston, to get work.” And Jerry could
utter this falsehood with so honest a look and so
smooth a tongue, as to deceive all who heard him!</p>

<p>“What is your name?” continued his inquisitive
host—for it was the keeper of the tavern that put
these questions.</p>

<p>“Jeremiah Preston.”</p>

<p>“And where did you say you belong?”</p>

<p>“In Brookdale.”</p>

<p>“And are you going to take the stage to-morrow
morning for Boston?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span></p>

<p>The tavern-keeper made several other inquiries,
which were answered to his satisfaction. He then left
the room, and presently returned and told Jerry that
his supper was ready. Following his host, Jerry entered
a long room, in the middle of which stood a table,
running nearly the whole length. At one end of this
table were spread the dishes and victuals for Jerry’s
supper, the rest of the household having been to tea.
There were warm biscuits and butter, rich milk, and
smoking tea, nice-looking cheese, and red, juicy applesauce,—besides
a plate of tempting cakes, and pies
of two kinds. A lady poured out a cup of tea, and
then left him to help himself to the eatables. His long
walk had given him a sharp appetite, and he availed
himself of this privilege very freely. It seemed to
him that he never sat down to so good a supper before.
He ate until he began to feel ashamed of himself, and
then left off, not because he had had enough, but because
he was afraid to eat more.</p>

<p>The demands of hunger satisfied, Jerry began to
realize how tired he was. He accordingly asked the
landlord to show him the way to his bed-room, which
the latter did. Before leaving him for the night, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
landlord told Jerry that the stage started at five
o’clock in the morning, and that he would call him in
season for it. Jerry then went to bed, and was soon
lost in sound sleep, from which he did not awake till a
loud and long-continued rapping on his door, and the
repeated cry of “stage ready!” at length elicited from
him the response, “I hear.” Scarcely knowing where
he was, or what all the disturbance was about, he
leaped out of bed, and was soon dressed, and ready
to resume his journey. His tavern bill was fifty cents,
which he paid, and without stopping for breakfast, he
took his seat in the stage that stood waiting at the door.
It was quite dark, and the snow was falling fast, a
driving wind piling it up in drifts. The stage, as it
was called, was a large covered sleigh, with three long
seats inside. Having fastened down the woollen curtains
to keep out the snow, the driver mounted his seat,
gave the word to the horses, and away they started.</p>

<p>For a large portion of the way, Jerry was the only
passenger. Now and then he could hear the crack of
the whip above the noise of the storm, and the sound
of the horses’ bells, deadened by the snow and wet,
was just audible. He could see nothing, for it was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
yet daylight, and besides, he was a close prisoner. He
could not even tell which way the vehicle was going.
Sometimes he thought it went sideways, and then again
it would seem to be going backwards. Sometimes,
with a jerk and a bounce he would be almost thrown
from his seat,—and at other times, it would seem as if
it were impossible to escape upsetting. For a while, he
was much amused with his situation, but at length he
began to grow tired of the continual thumping and jolting,
and longed to see the end of the journey. Several
more passengers were picked up, as they passed
through other villages, which, with the appearance of
daylight, served to enliven somewhat the remainder of
the way. But Jerry was not sorry when the driver
reined up the horses in front of one of the hotels in
Waterville. Hungry and benumbed with cold, he entered
the public house, and spoke for breakfast, which
was furnished very soon, as passengers were expected
by the stage. For this he paid twenty-five cents. It
was a very good breakfast, and well worth the money;
but he could not help thinking how many meals, quite
as good as this, he had eaten at home, without paying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</span>
anything for them. He began to feel the difference
between living at home and living abroad.</p>

<p>After breakfast, Jerry ascertained that he had about
two hours to spare, before the cars started, which he
thought he would spend in looking about. Waterville
seemed to him to be quite a large and bustling place.
The houses were numerous, and many of them were
very elegant. There were also plenty of stores and
work-shops, and quite a number of churches. The
Kennebec river, on one bank of which the town is
built, was frozen over, and the saw-mills were not in
operation. He went on to the covered bridge, which
crosses the Kennebec, where he obtained a good view
of the river, the mills, and a portion of the town. On
a hill, a short distance from the centre of the town, he
saw three large brick buildings, one of which had a
cupola. On inquiring of a boy what they were, he
was told they were “the colleges.”</p>

<p>Jerry now directed his steps to the railroad depot,
where he found preparations making for the train of
which he was to be a passenger. After examining
the locomotive, cars, depot, switches, turn-tables, signals,
etc., all of which possessed the charm of novelty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</span>
to him, he seated himself in the train. Soon the signal
was given for starting; the engine commenced its
at first slow but gradually quickening puffs; the bell
rang to warn people of the approach of the train, and
in a few minutes they were under full headway. Jerry
had travelled by railroad once or twice before, but the
novelty of the thing had not worn off, and he watched
the movements of the train, and the snow-covered
country through which they passed, with a good-deal
of interest. On they flew, over hills and valleys,
through forests and villages, over rivers and under
roads. The storm had ceased, and the snow on the
track was not sufficient to impede their progress. Occasionally
they stopped to take up or drop a passenger,
or to replenish the engine with water and fuel. The
ride, however was a long one,—eighty-two miles,—and
it was three hours and a half before they reached
Portland. After a while Jerry grew tired of looking
at strange scenes, and then his thoughts wandered back
to the home he had left. How he wished he could
look in unperceived, for a moment, and see what his
mother was doing! Was she sorry or angry, that he
had run away? Would she try to get him back again?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
What would the neighbors say about his disappearance?
And then he wondered how his sisters felt about losing
their brother. Little Mary, the youngest, he thought
would be sad, for she seemed to love him better than
the others did,—perhaps, because her affectionate disposition
and tender age did not allow him to treat her
so rudely as he did Emily and Harriet. He wished
that he had bidden her good-by, for really, he was just
learning that he felt something like affection towards
her. Such were the thoughts that were passing
through his mind, when the train stopped at the depot
in Portland.</p>

<p>Jerry had bought a through-ticket for Boston, and
was obliged to continue his journey without stopping
in Portland. He did not have time even to eat dinner,
but bought some cakes and a glass of milk at a refreshment
room in the depot, and then seated himself
in another train bound for Boston. Nothing occurred,
worthy of notice, during the trip. It grew dark before
the train had proceeded a third of its distance, and the
lamps in the cars were lighted. Of course nothing
could be seen, outside, save the lights in the villages
through which they passed. It was nearly eight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
o’clock in the evening when the train entered a large
building, lighted by gas lanterns, and the passengers
made a general movement towards the car-doors. Jerry
followed the others, and soon found, as he had already
suspected, that he was in Boston. The locomotive was
not to be seen, having been switched off upon another
track before the cars entered the depot; and the baggage
car, which followed immediately after the engine
and tender, was now unhitched from the cars, and some
men were pushing it forward to the farther end of the
depot. Here there was a raised platform, where the
baggage could be delivered, and which was fenced
round, so that no person could get at the car to help
themselves. The passengers soon began to crowd
around in search of their baggage, which was passed
out as fast as possible by men in the car. Each trunk,
valise, box, etc., had a number affixed to it, on a little
brass tag, or check; and as each passenger had received
a check with a number corresponding to that on
his trunk, the baggage-master had no difficulty in telling
to whom each article belonged. These checks
were given to the passengers when their baggage was
received at the depot in Portland, and on surrendering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
them in the Boston depot, they were sure of receiving
back their own baggage. As Jerry’s bundle was small,
he did not have it put among the baggage, but took it
with him into the cars.</p>

<p>A large number of men, with silver numbers on their
hats, were moving about among the passengers, accosting
almost everybody that they met with the words, “Cab,
sir?” “Hack, madam?” “Ride up, sir?” etc. On going
to the door, Jerry saw that there were a great
many coaches and cabs arranged along the side-walk,
waiting for the passengers. He was surprised to find that
all these vehicles were on wheels, and that the streets
were quite destitute of snow. He had not seen bare
ground before for several months; for in Brookdale
the snow often falls in the latter part of November,
and does not disappear till late in March. Boston being
farther south and nearer the sea-coast, the snow
does not accumulate in such quantities, nor remain so
long upon the ground, as it does in that part of Maine
where Jerry belonged.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="i_b143" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b143.jpg" alt="Haymarket Square">
</figure>
<br>

<p>Jerry now thought it was time to hunt up quarters
for the night. He was wholly unacquainted with the
streets, but he knew there were a great many public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
houses in the city; and he supposed he should not
have to go far, in any direction, to find one. On leaving
the depot, he found himself in a large, open square,
surrounded on all sides by tall buildings. In the centre
of the square, was a circular enclosure, surrounded
by an iron fence and a brick side-walk; and in the
centre of that was a tall, iron post supporting a gas-lamp.
This was Haymarket Square. Eight different
streets lead out of it, in various directions, and it was
some time before Jerry could decide which to take.
He, at length, chose one and started on his way, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
knowing whither it would lead him. He had not gone
far before he saw a building, which he thought might
be a hotel, and on inquiring of the driver of a carriage
which was standing before the door, he was told that it
was a public house. He accordingly ascended the
steps, and entered the room which had the word,
“Office,” painted over the door. Several men were
seated around a very large stove, reading; and another
was sitting at a desk, behind a counter that extended
across one end of the room. Going up to the
latter, Jerry said:—</p>

<p>“Can I stay here to-night, sir?”</p>

<p>The man addressed,—who was the clerk of the hotel,—eyed
the stranger somewhat sharply for a moment,
and then inquired:—</p>

<p>“Where are you from?”</p>

<p>“Brookdale,” replied Jerry.</p>

<p>“Brookdale,—I never heard of that place; where
is it?”</p>

<p>“It is in Maine,” answered Jerry, who was rather
surprised that the man should ask such a question.</p>

<p>“Come from there to-day?” continued the clerk.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span></p>

<p>“And what are you going to do in Boston?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to sea.”</p>

<p>“Have you got any baggage?”</p>

<p>“Nothing but this,” replied Jerry, holding up his
bundle.</p>

<p>“We don’t like to take strangers, who haven’t any
baggage,” continued the man; “they sometimes step
out very suddenly, without settling their bills.”</p>

<p>“If you are afraid to trust me, I can pay you in advance,”
replied Jerry, who began to fear he should
have to seek further for lodgings.</p>

<p>“O, never mind that,” said the clerk; “you look honest
enough; and as you’re fresh from the country, I
aint afraid to trust you. Put your name in that book,”
he continued, handing Jerry a pen, and placing a large
book on the counter.</p>

<p>This book was the register of the house, and each
guest who stopped there recorded in it his name and
place of residence. Jerry wrote his name as well as
he could,—which is not saying a great deal,—and
then inquired if he could not have something to eat.
The clerk replied in the affirmative; and, in a little
while, Jerry was summoned into another room, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
he found a good supper provided, of which he ate with
a keen relish after his long fast. Having finished his
meal, he told the clerk he was tired, and should like to
go to bed. The latter gave a pull at a cord and tassel,
which rang a bell in another part of the house. A
servant quickly answered the summons, and was directed
to show Jerry to No. 69. Following the
servant, Jerry passed through several narrow entries,
and ascended four long flights of stairs, and turned
more corners than he could remember, before he
reached his sleeping-room. It was a small room, and
had but a few plain articles of furniture. Jerry was
too tired, however, to give much attention to these
things. He was soon in bed, and sleeping as soundly
as though under his father’s roof.</p>

<span class="fs80">BOSTON.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> sun, streaming in from the window, awoke
Jerry from his slumbers, after his first night in
Boston. On getting up he found that his room was
higher than the surrounding buildings, affording an
extensive prospect. One of the first objects that met
his eye he concluded must be Bunker Hill Monument,
as it resembled the engravings he had seen of that
structure. There were a great many church-steeples
in sight, and the houses seemed to be crowded together
almost as close as they could be packed. He could
also see a strip of water, with numerous vessels, one
or two of which were very large, noble-looking ships.
These last were men-of-war, belonging to the American
Government, and were anchored off the Navy-Yard
at Charlestown.</p>

<p>But Jerry did not stop to gaze long at the novel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
scene spread before him. Other matters claimed his
attention. As he dressed himself he began to consider
what he should do next. He was acquainted with but
one family in the place,—that of his uncle,—and he
did not dare to go to them, lest they should send him
back to his home. If Oscar had only been at home,
he would have lost no time in seeing him; but he
knew, from letters received by his parents, that his
wayward cousin had gone to sea, several months before.
A stranger, in a great city, with no one to advise
or assist, and cast entirely upon his own resources, it
must be confessed that Jerry felt rather dull, that
morning. And yet he did not wish to return to his
home, and his greatest fear was that his friends would
discover where he was. He thought it would not be
safe to stay long in Boston, and so he determined to
try at once to get a chance to go to sea—a design on
which he had set his heart, before he started from
home.</p>

<p>Jerry’s reflections were interrupted by the ringing
of a large bell, in the entry below, and thinking it
might be the summons to breakfast, he went down.
Following the current of men and women, he found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
himself in a large hall, in which a long table was
spread. The man with whom he had the conversation
the night before, was there, and beckoned him to a
chair at the table. There were thirty or forty persons
at the table, and the rattling of dishes, the clatter of
knives and forks, and the low hum of conversation,
soon commenced in good earnest. Some six or eight
young men, in slippers and jackets, and wearing small
white aprons, were continually flying back and forth,
behind the boarders, bringing cups of tea and coffee,
and passing dishes to those who could not reach them.
Sometimes half a dozen persons would order as many
different things, of the same waiter, almost at the same
moment, and Jerry thought the man must be puzzled
to know which to get first; but in a minute he would
return, and hand to each the article which he ordered.
The skill which these men acquire in their business,
by practice, is often quite remarkable to one unaccustomed
to the sight.</p>

<p>The company did not all leave the table at once,
but one or two at a time, just as they happened to
finish their meal. Jerry having eaten all he desired,
arose and went to the office. The clerk of the hotel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
entered, soon after, and Jerry took the opportunity to
pay his bill, which amounted to seventy-five cents.
With his bundle in hand, he now started off, with the
design of shipping for a voyage, or, if he could not
do this, of procuring a cheap boarding place, where
he might remain until he could find a chance to go to
sea.</p>

<p>The streets were full of people, who all seemed intent
on going somewhere, as fast as possible. Jerry,
as he slowly passed along toward the point where he
had seen the ships from his chamber window, was
jostled first on one side and then on the other, and it
required no little effort to dodge the current which was
sweeping by him. This was partly because he did
not keep to the right side of the walk, as is the usual
custom in cities, but turned sometimes to the left, and
sometimes to the right, and sometimes took the centre.
Few of the persons he met seemed to take any notice
of him. Two boys, however, whose dress was better
than their manners, stopped almost directly in front of
him, and stared at him until he passed by, with a comical
expression on their faces. A loud laugh, and the
expression, “Aint he green, Sam!” which reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
the ears of Jerry, immediately after, explained their
conduct.</p>

<p>The horses and carriages in the street were quite as
novel a sight to Jerry, as the strange faces he met on
the side walk. A continuous line of vehicles, of all
descriptions, was passing back and forth. There were
long trucks, with two or three noble horses harnessed
“tandem,” and short cabs, which looked as though
they had been curtailed of their original proportions;
ponderous carts, with broad wheels, and light, gaily-painted
express wagons; omnibuses and coaches,
chaises and buggies, wheel-barrows and hand carts, all
passing in an endless procession. Jerry observed one
little incident that highly amused him. A small boy,
intent on having a free ride, got upon the steps at the
end of a passing omnibus; but he had hardly settled
himself into a comfortable position, when a passenger
inside, who had watched his proceedings, reached his
hand through the open window, and seizing his cap,
threw it high into the air. The lad’s face was in an instant
red with passion, and giving the man a look
which said as plain as looks could speak, “I’d pay
you for that—if I could,” away he ran to recover<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
his cap, which had fallen into the street; and so the
poor boy lost both his ride, and his temper.</p>

<p>Jerry continued his walk, and soon found himself in
the neighborhood of the shipping. Most of the
wharves, in this locality, are covered with coal, wood,
lumber, lime, and other products of the coasting trade.
Nearly all of the vessels lying at these wharves were
small, and Jerry noticed that many of them came from
ports in the State of Maine, the names of the towns
where they belonged being painted upon their sterns.
There was nothing very inviting to Jerry, about these
wharves, and he passed on. Presently, the wharves
began to grow longer, and the vessels larger. At one
place he encountered quite a crowd of people, and
several teams and carriages, which were coming up
from one of these wharves. This was the slip of the
Chelsea ferry-boats. Seeing a steamboat at the end
of the wharf, Jerry turned in, to look at it; but just
before reaching the boat, he was stopped by a man in
a loll-house, who told him that he could not pass without
paying the fare. Not wishing to go to Chelsea, at
that time, Jerry turned back, and resumed his walk
along Commercial street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span></p>

<p>As Jerry kept on, the shipping began to grow more
numerous, and almost everything he saw had something
to do with the sea. The most common signs on
the street were “Naval Stores,” “Ship Chandlery,”
“Sail Loft,” “Commission Merchant,” etc.; and on
most of the wharves were long blocks of warehouses
and stores, some of which were built of granite, and
made a very imposing and substantial appearance.
Sailors were plenty, too. Some of them were “old
salts” with great brown hands, and grizzled locks, and
little gold rings in their ears, and leather belts around
their waists, in which they carried their sheath-knives.
Some were young men, whose sun-burnt faces were
half buried in huge, dark whiskers, and whose pea-jackets
and pantaloons bore witness that they were not
unacquainted with grease and tar. Occasionally,
Jerry would meet a lad about his own size, whose dark
blue pants, fitting snugly around the waist and worn
without suspenders,—and neat blue jacket, with a
turned down shirt collar of the same color, edged with
white,—and shining tarpaulin hat, stuck upon the
back of his head,—at once excited his admiration and
envy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>Jerry now thought it time to look around among the
vessels, and see if he could accomplish the object of
his journey. He accordingly turned down a wharf at
which some twenty or thirty craft of various kinds
were lying, with the determination of applying to each
one of them for a situation, in regular order, until he
should be successful. The first two or three vessels
which he approached were apparently deserted. No
person was to be seen about them, and of course they
afforded no chance for Jerry. The next vessel he
came to was a large ship, which towered so high out
of the water that he could see nothing of the deck
from where he stood. There were some steps leading
from the wharf to the deck, which Jerry ascended.
The only person on board he could see was a negro,
who was in a little house built upon the deck, from the
top of which smoke was issuing through a stove-pipe.
This place was the caboose, or kitchen of the ship, and
its inmate was the cook. To the inquiry whether a
boy was wanted on board, a gruff “No” was the only
response. Jerry descended to the wharf, and continued
his walk, though with little success. On board some
of the vessels, the men were so busy at their labors<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
that he could get no answer to his inquiries; and those
who did notice him so much as to reply, were sure to
say “No.”</p>

<p>Jerry’s hopes began to fall very fast, and he felt his
courage giving way, in consequence of these continued
rebuffs. Still he thought he would not give up his
purpose yet, and so he passed along. He received the
usual reply, from the next vessel he approached, and
had just turned away, when he heard somebody cry
out:—</p>

<p>“Hallo, there, what youngster is that?”</p>

<p>On looking round, Jerry saw that the voice came
from a brig which was slowly moving past the vessel
on whose deck he stood.</p>

<p>“He’s a chap that wants to ship,” replied the sailor
to whom Jerry had spoken.</p>

<p>“You aint the boy that shipped with us yesterday,
are you?” continued the man on board the brig, as
Jerry turned towards him.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” replied Jerry, “but I should like to ship
with you.”</p>

<p>“Well, come along then—we’re off this minute,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
and can’t wait for the other fellow. You may take
his place—only be spry about it.”</p>

<p>Here the man, who was captain of the brig, gave
some orders in a loud tone to the crew, which were unintelligible
to Jerry. In a moment the brig was hauled
to along side the vessel in which Jerry was waiting,
and, in his confusion scarcely knowing what he did, he
quickly jumped over the railing, into the brig. The
sailors then re-commenced hauling her out from the
dock into the stream. Jerry threw his bundle down
upon the deck, and stood watching the movements of
those around him. He could scarcely realize that he
was going to sea, in this unceremonious manner, and
began to suspect that the sailors were playing a joke
upon him. But all seemed in earnest, and as busy as
they could be, and on the whole he concluded they
were not sporting with him. No one spoke to him,
however, or set him to work, and as he was as yet
totally unacquainted with the duties of a sailor-boy, he
did not venture to volunteer his services. But his long-cherished
hopes were realized, and his heart beat fast
at the prospect before him. Strange boy! He had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
shipped with no outfit for the voyage, and he did not
know where he was bound, nor even the name
of the vessel, or of the captain. He did not know
what wages he was to receive, what duties he
was expected to perform, or how long he was to be
absent. And yet he thought of none of these things,
so delighted was he to find himself actually afloat.
One by one the white sails of the brig were spread to
the wind, and she was soon in full headway towards
the broad ocean.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE SAILOR-BOY.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">For</span> the first few hours at sea, Jerry was little better
than a piece of lumber, in everybody’s way.
Nobody told him what to do, and, indeed, he was
pretty diligently employed in watching the quick
movements of the sailors, for the purpose of dodging
out of their path. But, with all his alertness, he was
not quick enough to avoid being sometimes rudely
shoved one side, with a muttered imprecation on his
head for getting in the way. The city now began to
recede rapidly from view. The State House dome,
the church spires, and the forest of ship-masts along
the water-side, were all that could be distinguished in
the city proper. East Boston, with clouds of smoke
ascending from its numerous foundries, was in full
view in the distance; while nearer at hand, on the
right, was South Boston, with its highlands, its large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
public buildings, and its many work-shops with tall
chimneys. The last sound that came from shore, was
the striking of the church clocks. There was a brisk
north-west wind, before which the brig dashed along at
a rapid rate. Soon they were sailing between two fortresses,
situated on islands about a mile apart, and
commanding the only channel by which large vessels
can enter or leave the port. Several other islands
were in sight, on some of which there were large
buildings. They also passed near two light-houses—tall
towers built on islands, with dwelling-houses near
by for their keepers. Towards noon, the pilot, whose
business it is to guide vessels in and out of the harbor,
took leave of the brig, and returned to port in a small
sail-boat. But little land was now in sight, and the
broad ocean, dotted with white sails, was spread out
before them.</p>

<p>The sun shone pleasantly upon the waters, but the
wind was raw and cold, and Jerry began to realize
that he must stir about to keep warm. He was slowly
sauntering along, to see for the fiftieth time if he could
find anything to do, when he was accosted in a rough
voice by one of the men, who said:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span></p>

<p>“Here, you land-lubber, did you ship for a gentleman,
or a figure-head, or what do you mean to do with
yourself?”</p>

<p>“I mean to do my duty, if anybody will tell me
what it is,” replied Jerry, who did not like the tone in
which he was addressed, and answered accordingly.
The surly manner in which this was said, was more
objectionable than the language itself. In an instant,
the man to whom it was addressed (who was the chief-mate),
gave Jerry a blow with his hard fist, which sent
the boy reeling across the deck.</p>

<p>“There, you young snapping-turtle,” said he, “that’s
your first lesson; and hereafter look out when you’re
spoken to, and give a civil answer, or I’ll crack your
tow-head for you. Now bear a hand here, and clean
out that pig-pen,” he continued, pointing to a shovel
and scrubbing brush standing in one corner.</p>

<p>Pigs and poultry are frequently carried to sea, to
furnish a supply of fresh meat for passengers and sailors;
but these particular pigs, to whose acquaintance
Jerry was so summarily introduced, were themselves
passengers, on their way to a foreign land. A small
pen had been fitted up for them on deck, and as cleanliness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
is one of the cardinal virtues on ship-board, it
was necessary that they should be continually looked
after. And cleaning out a hog-sty was to be Jerry’s
first experience of “a life on the ocean wave!” Had
any one at home ordered him to do such a job, it is
very doubtful whether he would have obeyed; but
here, after the lesson he had just received, he dare not
refuse or even hesitate, and so he leaped into the pen,
scraped up the filth, and threw it overboard.</p>
<br>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b162.jpg" alt="Sea-sickness">
</figure>
<br>

<p>Shortly after Jerry had completed this useful but
most unromantic task, he began to grow ill. His
stomach rolled and pitched with the brig, and his head
was light and dizzy. When he walked he reeled like
a drunken man, and the deck seemed about to fly up
into his face. Every moment, his sensations became
more distressing. He laid himself down in a sheltered
part of the deck, but found no relief. His pale, wo-be-gone
countenance bore the impress of his misery.
O, how he wished he was once more on shore! How
he cursed in his heart the hour that he turned his
wayward steps from Brookdale! As the motion of
the vessel rolled him about like a log, he almost wished
that it might pitch him overboard, and thus put an end<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
to his misery. Should such an accident happen, it
seemed to him he would not lift a finger to escape
a watery grave. Such thoughts as these were passing
through the brain of the sea-sick boy, when some one
stole slyly up behind him, and dropped a large piece
of greasy salt pork almost directly into his mouth.
Any fatty substance is very disagreeable to a sea-sick
person; and this mischievous prank, with the
laughter and jibes of the sailors which followed it, put
the climax upon the misery of Jerry. He got upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
his feet, and, clinging to the rail, began to vomit, or
“throw up Jonah,” as the sailors term it. The more
he retched, and gagged, and groaned, the more his tormentors
ridiculed him. The most conspicuous among
them was a raw, freckle-faced lad, apparently a little older
than himself, who was now on his second voyage, and
was retaliating upon Jerry the treatment he had himself
suffered but six or eight months before. He it
was that dropped the pork into Jerry’s face. The
sailors called him Bob, for they seldom use any but
nick-names, and those of the shortest kind.</p>

<p>Jerry remained upon the deck nearly all the afternoon;
and no one, from Bob to the Captain, took any
notice of him, except to laugh at his condition. Sea-sick
people generally get but little sympathy from old
salts. Towards sunset, feeling no better, Jerry asked
one of the sailors if he would please to show him to
his bed-room,—for, in his simplicity, it had never occurred
to him that a bed-room, and even a bed, were
luxuries that did not belong to the sea. The old tar,
with the utmost gravity, called out:—</p>

<p>“Come here, Bob,—this ’ere young gentleman
wants you to show him the way up to his bed-room.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span></p>

<p>Bob came, and conducted Jerry to the ratlin, or
ladder, leading up the mast,—and told him to “go up
two pair of stairs, and knock at the left-hand door.”
If there was anything funny in this, Jerry was too sick
to apprehend it. His good-nature had long since given
out; but now he was getting positively angry, and retorted
upon his tormentors with some spirit. But this
only increased their sport and aggravated his misery.
At length, however, they became weary of their bantering,
and one of the sailors, whom they called Tom,
led Jerry down into the forecastle, as that part of the
vessel, where the sailors sleep, is called. This apartment
was in the forward part of the brig, immediately
under the deck. It was a small place, barely high
enough to stand erect in, and with no light except what
entered at the door-way. Great chests were strewed
around the floor, so that it was difficult to walk without
running into them. The sides of the forecastle were
fitted up with three tiers of what looked like large
shelves, with raised edges. These were the bunks in
which the sailors slept. Each man had his own bunk,
which was just large enough to lie down in. Two or
three of these bunks were unclaimed, and Tom told<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
Jerry he could take his choice of them. But Jerry
had come on board without the slightest preparation
for sea, and of course had neither mattress nor blankets,
which each sailor is expected to provide for himself.
What was he to do in this emergency? Luckily
for him, Tom happened to have some spare bed-clothing
in his chest; and as he rather pitied Jerry, he
offered to let him use it until he should have an opportunity
to furnish himself with an outfit. Jerry
gladly accepted the offer, and taking off a portion of
his clothing, crawled into this narrow, box-like resting-place.</p>

<p>Our young sailor did not enjoy a very sound sleep,
on his first night at sea. The motion of the vessel, the
creaking and straining of the rigging, the noise of the
water dashing against the bows, the dolorous sighing
of the wind through the blocks and ropes, the loud,
sharp-spoken orders on deck, and the frequent passing
of the seamen to and from the forecastle, together with
his sea-sickness, allowed him but little repose. Nor
did he quite fancy the atmosphere of the forecastle,
which became close and stifled before morning, and was
flavored with various odors, the most prominent of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
which seemed to be tar, bilge-water, and tobacco.
However, he made out to catch a few short naps, from
one of which, about daylight, he was aroused by a
hearty shake, and ordered on deck. It at first seemed
to him that he had not strength sufficient to arise, but
he managed to get upon his feet, and staggered up on
deck, where the mate at once set him to work, washing
down the decks. Weak and sick as he was, he worked
at the pump awhile, the cold water in the meantime
running in streams about his feet, his shoes offering but
little resistance to the flood. Then he was obliged to
kneel down and scrub the deck with small stones, called
by the sailors, “holy-stones,” and used at sea for cleaning
the decks of vessels. This laborious employment
continued for more than an hour, and whenever Jerry
attempted to relax his efforts in the slightest degree, he
would hear the stern voice of the mate:—</p>

<p>“Bear a hand there, sir,—no skulking here!”</p>

<p>On one occasion, this admonition was enforced by a
smart stroke of a rope’s-end laid over his shoulders.
Jerry began to regard the mate as a monster; and, indeed,
he looked upon the officers and men, generally,
as little better than the pirates of whom he had read<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
in some of his juvenile books. But these men were
not so bad as he imagined. It is stern, rough discipline
that makes the hardy sailor; and Jerry’s initiation was
no more severe than that of most boys who go to sea
“before the mast.”</p>

<p>After the deck had been holy-stoned, Jerry made his
first meal at sea,—he having been too sick hitherto to
eat anything. His breakfast consisted of hard ship-bread,
cold salt junk, or beef, and rye coffee, without
milk. He ate but little, for the fare was not very
tempting, and his stomach had not yet got accustomed
to the ups and downs, the pitchings, and tossings, and
reelings, of a life at sea. He was kept busily employed,
most of the day, in doing various little chores about the
vessel; for being the youngest, he was obliged to run
at everybody’s call. He learned from one of the sailors,
during the day, that the brig was bound for Valparaiso;
but this did not give him a very definite idea
of his destination,—for so sadly had he neglected his
geography at school, that he could not tell in what
quarter of the globe Valparaiso was situated, or
whether it was a week’s, or month’s, or six months’ sail<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
from Boston. He also discovered that the name of the
brig was “The Susan.”</p>

<p>Towards the evening of the second day out, the
weather grew milder and the sea more calm. The
brig, which had dashed through the water as if on a
race, from the moment they got under headway, now
began to slacken her speed,—and one of the old sailors
predicted an “Irishman’s hurricane,” as a calm is
sometimes humorously called. The motion of the vessel
was much less perceptible, and Jerry began to get
over his sea-sickness. He now took some interest in
the strange scenes spread out before him: the level
ocean stretching away in every direction, until it apparently
touched the sky; no hill bounding the horizon,
and not a speck of land to be seen. But one other
vessel was in sight, and that was so far off that only
the white sails could be discerned, the hull being hidden
from sight by the roundness of the earth. Dolphins
and porpoises were sporting round the brig in a
very amusing manner,—now darting entirely out of
water, and now plunging to the bottom, or scudding
along very swiftly near the surface. Occasionally, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
small bird was seen flitting past the vessel, or skimming
along upon the water, in its wake. At first, Jerry took
them to be swallows, but he soon learned from Tom,
that they were stormy petrels, or, as the sailors call
them, Mother Carey’s Chickens. The sailors regard
these birds with much superstitious fear, because they
appear in greatest numbers just before a storm, and
are besides very singular in their habits; but the petrels
are really very inoffensive birds, and have no more
to do with getting up a tempest than our ducks, geese,
swallows, snow-birds, and other land birds, which are
uncommonly noisy and busy just before a storm. Tom,
however, like most sailors, believed the traditions concerning
the petrel, and when he told Jerry they were
messengers of the evil one, they lost none of their interest
in the eyes of the young sailor. At night, while
stowed away in his little bunk, sound asleep, they appeared
to him in countless flocks, and he dreamed that
they settled around him in such vast numbers, that he
had to struggle desperately to avoid being suffocated
by them.</p>

<p>Thus passed Jerry’s first two days at sea. You
would hardly have patience to follow him through all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
the long voyage; nor is it necessary that you should,
for the experience of one day was much like that of
another. He found going to sea a very different
thing from what he expected. To be sure, there were
at first some pleasant novelties about it, but these wore
away after a while. This was not the case, however,
with the toils and hardships,—which only grew more
distasteful the longer they were continued. The romantic,
free-and-easy life of the sailor, which he had
pictured in imagination, he found to be in reality a life
of severe labor, drudgery, exposure, and deprivation.
There were few idle moments for him, even in the most
delightful weather. At daylight, each morning, rain
or shine, he must scrub the decks; and clean out the
pig-pen. Next, perhaps, he would be ordered to assist
in shifting sails, and would be obliged to haul rough
ropes until his hands were sore, and his back felt ready
to break; then, for an hour or two, he would be kept
hard at work scraping and oiling the masts and yards,—or
be sent aloft with a bucket of tar and grease,
called slush, and, hanging in mid-air, be compelled to
dip his hand into the nasty mixture, and rub down
some portion of the rigging or mast. He also had his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>
own washing and mending to do; and when there was
nothing else to employ his time, he must pick oakum,
or make spun-yarn and sennit. Even at night, he
could not claim exemption from toil,—but was liable
at any hour to be turned out by the shrill cry of “All
hands, ahoy!” to face rain or snow, or to feel his way
aloft in a gale of wind, and in pitch-darkness!</p>

<p>There was one thing, however, that Jerry, at first,
felt more than even the hard work and poor fare of his
new calling; this was, the iron discipline to which he
found himself subjected. He had never been accustomed
to obey any one, at home; but here, it was
prompt, instant obedience, or a blow. This deep-rooted
habit of disobedience, together with his settled
habit of laziness, made his “breaking in” at sea much
more painful than it would otherwise have been. One
morning he did not instantly obey the summons when
called up, and, without intending it, dropped asleep
again; a moment afterwards he found himself sprawling
among the chests in the forecastle, every bone in
his body aching as though it had been twitched out of its
place. The captain, with one jerk, had brought him
from his bunk to the floor, and accompanied the act<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
with an imprecation on his eyes, for not turning out
when called. Jerry had to take his turn in watching
on deck, at night. One night he was greatly fatigued,
and sitting down on the boom he fell asleep with his
head in his lap. The second mate happened to be on
deck, and seeing the situation of Jerry, he seized the
rope’s-end, and approaching him stealthily, brought it
down with all his strength upon the back and shoulders
of the boy. Jerry, in his fright, came near leaping
overboard, and it was a long time before he again took
a nap at the watch. At work, too, a kick, or cuff, or a
bit of rope was always handy, if there was any inclination
to skulk. “Hurrah, there! bear a hand! heave
along! heave along!” was constantly sounding in his
ears,—a system of driving which he found anything
but agreeable.</p>

<p>Jerry also added unnecessarily to the bitterness of
his lot, during the first few weeks of the voyage, by
his surly, insolent manners towards the sailors. Being
treated as inferiors themselves by their officers, sailors
have no opportunity to play the superior except towards
the boys on ship-board, and they are very apt to
make the most of this opportunity. It is best for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
boy to submit patiently and good-naturedly to this
petty tyranny; for, if he is saucy or surly, they show
him no mercy. Jerry soon learned this, from his own
experience. He at first bore the treatment of the
crew with much ill-grace; but he was soon cured of
this fault, and learned to be civil and obliging towards
them.</p>

<p>In addition to all these troubles and hardships, Jerry
found himself thrown into intimate companionship
with men, some of whom were not only shockingly
profane and disgustingly indecent, in their language,
but even boasted of the immorality of their lives. But
these evil influences, though they startled Jerry a little,
at first, were not the things that troubled him;—and
yet, with his unformed habits and principles, they were
a thousand times worse for him than all the stern hardships
of the sea.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Jerry</span> was missed at home;—to be sure, his departure
was not felt so sensibly as it would have
been, had he acted the part of a dutiful son and an
affectionate brother. Still, all mourned his sudden disappearance;
especially, as they knew not what had become
of him. For a while, Mrs. Preston looked up the
road, many times every day, to see if she could discern
anything of the runaway, for she had strong expectations
that he would return. But he did not come, nor
were any tidings received from him. In her distress
and anxiety on his account, she forgot all his bad conduct,
and only remembered that he was her son,—her
only son. Little Mary, too, was much troubled at the
loss of her brother. She did not fully comprehend the
occasion of his absence, and as little was said in her
presence about it, she somehow got the notion into her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
head that Jerry had been seized and carried off by certain
wicked people whom she called “bugaboos.”
“Mother,” she would say, “when Jerry gets to be a
great-big man, wont he get away from the bugaboos;
and come back again?” And then her mother would
look sad, and reply, “I hope so, my dear.”</p>

<p>About a fortnight after Jerry’s departure, Mrs. Preston
received a letter from her husband’s brother in
Boston. She opened it with mingled hope and trembling,
for it was in reply to one she had addressed him,
the day after Jerry left home. But it gave her no information
in regard to his whereabouts. Jerry’s uncle
simply stated that he had been absent from home, and did
not get her letter till a few days previous; that he had
made inquiries, but could learn nothing of Jerry; and
that he would be on the look-out for him, and give her
immediate information should he hear anything concerning
the runaway. She laid the letter down with a
sigh; and that evening she wrote to her husband, informing
him of the situation of affairs,—for she had
delayed doing so until now, in hope of hearing what
had become of Jerry. Being at work in the woods,
far away from any post-office, Mr. Preston did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
receive this letter until it had got to be quite an old
affair, and so he did not think it worth while to return
home, to look after his son.</p>

<p>Clinton continued to be a frequent visiter at Mrs.
Preston’s, and was regarded as one of the family,
rather than a stranger. When riding down to the
Cross Roads, he always stopped to inquire if they had
any errands to be done at the store; and often, when
going back and forth, he would drop in a few moments,
to chat with the children, or join in their sports.
There was in the yard a great image of snow, twice as
large as a man, which Clinton had made to amuse little
Mary. The frequent thawings and freezings to which
this snow giant was subjected, gave him a smooth,
thick coating of ice, so that a snow ball made no impression
upon him. This, Clinton said, was his coat
of mail. By causing water to drop down its chin,
when it was freezing cold, Clinton made a beard of
icicles for the image, which gave it a very grotesque
look. One morning, after a thaw, Mary was highly
delighted with a discovery she made of a long icicle
hanging from the nose of the “old man,” as she called
him. A few days after there was a heavy fall of moist<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
snow, which swelled the image to gigantic proportions,
the outline of the figure being still
preserved; but soon it tumbled to
pieces of its own weight, and only
a heap of hardened snow and ice
remained to tell its story.</p>

  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b177.jpg" alt="The snow image">
</figure>

<p>Clinton was a
favorite with the
family, and his
visits gave them
much pleasure;
yet Mrs. Preston
could not look upon
him without a
feeling of sadness, for his presence always reminded
her of her own son—the playmate from infancy of
Clinton. Nor could she help contrasting their characters
and prospects. She thought what a difference
a few years had made, in the two boys; and then she
wondered whether this difference was to go on, ever
widening, to the end of their lives.</p>

<p>Thus week after week passed away, and the family
were beginning to recover from the melancholy occasioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
by Jerry’s flight from home, when a new and
unwelcome guest entered the house. This guest was
sickness, and Mary was its victim. She grew ill so
alarmingly fast, from the hour of her attack, that
James was soon despatched for the doctor. When
this functionary arrived, he felt of Mary’s pulse and
temples, looked at her tongue, and made some inquiries
of her mother in relation to her symptoms. He
then pronounced her to be in a fever, but expressed
some hope of being able to throw it off. Opening the
little leathern trunk, which he always carried with him
in his professional visits, he took from it several kinds
of medicines, and gave them to Mary’s mother, with
directions how to administer them. But Mary continued
to grow worse and worse, in spite of the good
doctor’s medicine. She tossed about on her little bed,
moaning piteously, and complaining continually of the
dreadful pain in her head. Night came, and she could
not sleep, although the lamp in the room was shaded,
and her mother moved noiselessly about in her gentle
ministries to the sick one. Every little while she
would call for drink, for she said she was burning up
with the heat; but she ate nothing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span></p>

<p>The doctor called the next day, and after the usual
examination, he left some more medicine, and departed.
But his little patient grew no better. And so daily he
repeated his visits, and each time remained longer, and
looked more anxious; but his skill seemed to be of
little avail. At length one morning, as Emily and
Harriet were sitting at the bed-side of the sufferer,
while their mother was necessarily absent, Mary awoke
from a short, troubled sleep, and, with a wild, unnatural
look, began to talk very fast and very singularly about
a great many different things.</p>

<p>“There’s my old snow man,” she said, pointing to a
bed-post on which some light-colored clothing was
hanging; “old man, old man, old man, do you know
who made you? I know who it was—’twas Clinty.
O mother, see that! see that! isn’t it beautiful! Now
it’s gone, and I shan’t see it again. Yes I will too.
There it goes—buz-z-z-z-z—do n’t you sting me,
you naughty bee—I’ll tell my mother if you do.
See! see! see! there he comes—that’s Jerry—no
it aint—yes it <em>is</em> too—I tell you it <em>is</em> Jerry—don’t
you see him? O, how glad I am he’s got away from
the bugaboos! Look! look quick! that’s him—there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
it goes—up there—don’t you see it way up there,
going round and round? By-low baby,—by-low
baby,” she continued, twisting the bed-clothes into
something that seemed to her a doll; and then she
repeated a verse of one of her little songs:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Dance, little baby, dance up high;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Never mind, baby, mother is by;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Crow and caper, caper and crow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">There, little baby, there you go.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus she continued to talk, her mind flying from one
thing to another in a most singular manner. Her sisters
spoke to her, but she took no notice of them; and
Harriet ran down to her mother, and bursting into
tears, cried:—</p>

<p>“O, mother, do come up stairs—Mary’s gone crazy,
and is talking about everything!”</p>

<p>The poor little sufferer continued in a delirious state
most of the day, though occasionally, for a few moments
at a time, reason would seem to resume its sway.
The doctor looked more grave than ever, and when
Mrs. Preston followed him into the entry, and entreated
him to tell her exactly what he thought of the
case, he replied:—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>“I think she is a very sick child, but as the fever
has not reached the turning-point, it is impossible to
tell how it will result. I do not despair of saving her,
however, for I have seen more than one patient live
through as violent an attack as this appears to be.”</p>

<p>Clinton called daily at the house, to inquire after
Mary, but as it was important to keep her as quiet as
possible, he did not go into the sick chamber. His
mother, however, came over every day, and sometimes
remained all night, greatly assisting Mrs. Preston in
taking care of the sick one. Mary’s delirium continued
with little interruption for two or three days.
When she came out of this state, she cast a recognizing
look at her mother and sisters, who were
seated in the room, and then, in a low voice, inquired:—</p>

<p>“Mother, where is Jerry?”</p>

<p>“Jerry is not here, dear,” replied Mrs. Preston;
“he has not yet got back.”</p>

<p>“Where has he gone?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know where he is—he went away before
you was taken sick, but we hope he will be back
soon.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>“But I saw him here yesterday, mother,” continued
Mary, who had a confused remembrance of some of
the impressions of her delirium.</p>

<p>“No, darling, you are mistaken, you dreamed that
you saw him—that was all.”</p>

<p>Mary looked disappointed; and as her recollection
of Jerry’s disappearance returned, she added mournfully:—</p>

<p>“Then I shan’t see Jerry again before I die—nor
father either.”</p>

<p>“O, yes you will,” quickly replied her mother,
startled at these words; “you will soon get well, I hope,
and father will be home, before many weeks, and Jerry,
too, perhaps.”</p>

<p>Mary sadly shook her head, but made no reply.
That night she slept a few hours, but in the morning
it was evident that she was rapidly failing. Calling
her mother to the bed-side, she said, with a beautiful
smile upon her face:—</p>

<p>“Dear mother, I am going to-day—I have seen
the angel that is to carry me over the river. O, I
wish I could tell you all about it, but I can’t talk much
now. I saw a beautiful country—there was no snow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
there, but the grass was all green, and there were flowers
of every kind. There was a great temple, too, as high
as the clouds, and it dazzled my eyes to look at it, it
glittered so in the sun. And I saw thousands of little
children, dressed in white, and the Saviour gathered
them around him, and kissed them, and then they all
sang, and looked so happy, and <em>he</em> looked so kind. But
there was a dark, ugly river between me and them,
and while I was thinking how I should like to get
across, a tall, beautiful angel came up to me, and asked
me if I would not like to become one of the Saviour’s
little lambs. I told him I should, but I was afraid of
the terrible river. Then he kissed me, and told me
not to be afraid, for he would come for me in a few
hours, and carry me over; and he said I never should
be sick any more, nor go astray. And I asked if he,
would not take you too, and father, and Jerry, and
Emily, and Harriet, but he said:—‘Not yet.’ And
while the angel was talking to me, the Saviour looked
towards us, and stretched out his arms; and so I am
sure that I shall go to heaven to-day.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Preston listened to this recital in tears, and
was too much overpowered with her emotions to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span>
any reply. It was but too evident that Mary’s presentiment
of her approaching death was not unlikely
to prove true. She continued to sink through the day.
The doctor came once more, but he told the weeping
mother he could do nothing more for the sufferer. In
the afternoon, Mary desired that all the members of
the family should be gathered around her. In a few
simple, childish words, she bade each a farewell, and
looked the affection which she could not express. And
then, remembering the absent ones, she left messages
of love for her father and Jerry. She soon after sank
into a stupor, and apparently did not recognize her
mother and sisters, who sat silently and tearfully watching
her breathing, as each minute it became shorter and
more labored. Just as the last spark of life was expiring,
a heavenly smile beamed upon her pure young face,
and the exclamation, “There he is!—the angel is
coming!” faintly trembled upon her lips. A moment
after, little Mary was gathered into the fold of the
Good Shepherd, in heaven.</p>

<p>A little grave was dug in the frozen earth, in one
corner of the garden, and there the dust of Mary now
sleeps, in hope of a resurrection. But it is only the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span>
body that lies there. <em>She</em> went with the good angel,
we trust, to become one of the lambs in the Saviour’s
flock.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE FORESTS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">March</span> had come—the month which is usually
considered the beginning of spring, though in the
part of the country where Clinton resided it seemed
more like the last month of winter. The winter school
had closed, and as it was too early to commence labors
on the farm, the scholars were enjoying a long holiday.
There was little for Clinton to do, at home, and even
his father was at leisure much of the time, having
chopped and hauled his year’s supply of wood, cleaned
and repaired his tools, and done such other jobs as are
usually deferred to the winter season. The deportment
of Clinton, since his frank confession of the errors
into which Jerry had led him, had been unexceptionable,
both at home and at school. He seemed like
himself again. His parents began to feel sorry that
they had deprived him of his promised journey to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
Boston, although he had never once spoken of the
matter from the day they announced their intention. In
talking over the subject one evening after the children
had gone to bed, they concluded to make up for Clinton’s
disappointment, in part at least, by treating him to an
excursion of another kind. The next morning, at the
breakfast table, Mr. Davenport introduced the matter
by saying:—</p>

<p>“Clinton, you’ve behaved pretty well, for some
time past, and as I believe in rewards as well as punishments,
I am going to propose to treat you to a little
excursion, next week. Where should you prefer to
go—to Portland, or to Bangor, or back into the forests,
among the loggers? As the sleighing is now excellent,
and bids fair to remain so for a week or two
longer, we will take Fanny—or rather she shall take
us; and you shall decide to which of these points we
shall steer.”</p>

<p>“I should like to go to either of the places, first-rate,”
said Clinton, “but I don’t know as I have any
choice about them. I’ll leave it with you to say which
shall be the trip.”</p>

<p>“No,” resumed his father, “you think the matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
over to-day, and perhaps you will find that you have
some preference.”</p>

<p>Clinton did so, and after weighing in his mind the
attractions of the several places, he came to the conclusion
that he had rather visit a logging camp, of
which he had heard so much, than to go to either
Portland or Bangor. He had already once visited the
former city, and the other had no special interest for
him, beyond any other large place. So he informed
his father of his decision, and the logging camp was
determined upon as the object of their journey.</p>

<p>The rest of the week was spent in preparing for
and talking about their approaching excursion. Clinton
watched the weather very closely, and was constantly
on the look out for a storm; but no storm
came, though there were at times indications of foul
weather, which somewhat dampened his ardor. His
mother cooked a large amount of dough-nuts, ginger
cakes, fried apple pies, and other eatables convenient
for a journey; for they were going through a section of
the country which was little settled, and might have to
depend upon themselves, in part at least, for their provisions.
The sleigh was cleaned, and even Fanny<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
received extra care, and an extra allowance of fodder,
in consideration of the long jaunt before her.</p>

<p>Monday morning, at length, came. The weather was
just what they desired. The sun shone pleasantly, the
air was mild, and the sleighing,—which had not been
interrupted for a day, since the first considerable fall of
snow in December,—was smooth and easy. Mrs.
Davenport stowed away in the sleigh-box, under the
seat, an ample supply of provisions for the journey;
and, also, a quantity of extra clothing, to be used in
case they should need a change. Nor did Mr. Davenport
forget to provide something for Fanny’s comfort
on the way. He lashed a bag of grain between the
dasher and the front of the sleigh, and inside he put as
much hay as he could conveniently carry, tied up in
wisps of a convenient size for bating the horse. Some
friction matches, an umbrella, a rifle, a hatchet, and
two good buffalo skins, completed their outfit.</p>

<p>The sun was hardly half an hour up, when Clinton
and his father bade good-bye to Mrs. Davenport and
Annie, and started on their journey. The logging
business is carried on most extensively around the
head waters of the great rivers in the northern part of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
Maine. These, however, were too far distant, and the
roads to them too little travelled, to be visited with
much pleasure or even safety, at this season of the
year. The camp which Mr. Davenport intended to
visit was situated on one of the tributaries of the Kennebec
river, about forty miles from Brookdale. Here
they could obtain quite as correct an idea of the
loggers’ life as they could by going farther north,
though the business was carried on upon a smaller
scale at this place.</p>

<p>Fanny trotted off at a brisk pace, and soon the
travellers found themselves upon a road where no
houses nor cultivated land could be seen,—but tall forest
trees rose on each side, and spread away in the
distance as far as the eye could see.</p>

<p>“What lots of woods,” said Clinton; “I don’t see
why they go so far after logs, when they are so plenty
around here.”</p>

<p>“I suppose one reason is,” said his father, “that
these forests are not very convenient to a stream, so
that the logs could not be easily floated down to the
saw-mills. Perhaps, too, the land belongs to somebody
who thinks the lumber will be more valuable by and by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
than it is now. There are many large tracts of wood
scattered over the State, even in parts which have been
settled for years.”</p>

<p>“I should think it would take a great many ages to
use up all the wood there is in this State,” continued
Clinton.</p>

<p>“I hope it will be a great while,” remarked Mr.
Davenport, “before we are as badly off for wood as
they are in some parts of the old world. What would
you think of buying fire-wood by the pound? Yet this
is the way it is sold in Paris and many other European
cities. A man who had travelled a great deal, once
told me that he had known wood to sell at the rate of
eighty-five dollars a cord, in Naples. In France, and
Spain, too, wood is very scarce, and as but little coal is
used, the people learn to be very economical in the use
of fuel. He says it would cost a fortune for a man
to keep up such fires in his house, in Paris, as we do
here. The trimmings of fruit trees and grape vines, and
everything that will burn, is carefully saved. Lumber,
for building purposes, is also much dearer than it is
here, and is much less used than with us. But some
people think the time will come when wood and lumber<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
will be as dear here as they are now in Europe.”</p>

<p>Patches of fenced lands, some of which had evidently
been cultivated, now began to appear, and in a few
minutes a little settlement of farm-houses became visible;
but the travellers did not stop, and were soon
again in the forests, with no signs of civilization around
them but the road upon which they travelled. Most
of the pine trees had been cut down, in this tract, but
a few lofty and noble specimens remained, as if to show
what had been there. The stumps of these departed
giants of the forest were scattered in every direction,
and some of them were of great size. They had no
measuring tape, but Mr. Davenport, after carefully
examining one of these stumps, calculated that it
measured fully seventeen feet in circumference, at the
“cut.” There was a pine still standing, near by, which
he thought would measure almost as much as this. Its
height he estimated at one hundred and thirty feet.</p>

<p>But though there were few white pines left, there
was no lack of trees. Among those which Clinton
recognized, was a small, scraggy species of pine; the
stiff, cone-shaped cedar; the mountain ash, with its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
clusters of bright red berries; the noble and cleanly
beech; the thrifty, broad-headed butternut; the graceful
birch, with its silvery trunk; the maple, the larch,
the spruce, etc. There was also a dense growth of
smaller trees or bushes, among which he found the hazel,
filbert, moose-wood, alder, bear-berry, winter-green,
and other familiar shrubs. The conversation turned
upon the properties and uses of these several trees,—for
Mr. Davenport always improved such occasions for
giving Clinton useful information concerning the objects
around him. He told him what an excellent substitute
beech leaves were for straw, for filling beds; and how
valuable the sugar-maples will one day be considered,
when the people get in the way of making sugar as an
article of export; and how the Shakers use the wood
of the butternut for making bowls, and sell the bark to
the apothecaries for medicinal purposes; and how fond
the partridge is of the little red bear-berries.</p>

<p>“As to the birches, which are so plenty along here,
I suppose you already know something of their peculiar
virtues,” continued Mr. Davenport.</p>

<p>“I guess a few of the boys at school discovered what
they are good for, this winter,” replied Clinton, with a
laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>“Well, I made the same discovery myself, when I
went to school,” added Mr. Davenport. “The master
got out of birch rods, one day, and sent me off to cut
some. The tree which we usually patronized for this
purpose was near by a pond where there happened to
be excellent skating; and as my skates were handy, I
having hid them under a log before going into school,
I thought I would take a turn or two round the pond,
after cutting the twigs. I did so; and then returned
to school, with half a dozen long, stout rods. As the
master took them, he said, with a smile, ‘Ah, these
look nice, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating,
so I will just test them a little.’ I laughed at his
pleasantry, and turned to go to my seat, when he
said, ‘Here, sir, come back, I’m in earnest—I want
to test these a little before you take your seat.’ And
sure enough, he did test one of the longest of them,
so that I carried proofs of its virtues upon my legs for
several days after. ‘There,’ said he, after he had
satisfied himself, ‘these rods will do very well; now
you may go to your seat, and when I send you after
the next lot, <em>don’t you stop to skate on the pond</em>!’ I
afterwards learned that he grew suspicious of my long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
absence, and sent out a boy to see what had become
of me, who reported to him that I was skating. Ever
since that day, I have had a very lively recollection of
the virtues of the birch tree.”</p>

<p>“Master Eaton often says boys are subject to some
complaints that have to be doctored on the botanical
system—he says there is nothing but oil of birch that
will save them,” remarked Clinton.</p>

<p>“Speaking of the oil of birch,” said Mr. Davenport,
“did you know that it is valuable for tanning leather,
as well as boys’ hides?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I didn’t know there was really such a
thing as the oil of birch,” replied Clinton. “I thought
people used the words only in fun.”</p>

<p>“There is such a substance, and it is said to be used
in tanning hides, and currying leather, in Russia.
They distil it from the outside bark of the tree. Did
you never notice that the birch-bark often remains entire,
after the tree to which it belonged has gone to
decay?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I know some trees back of our house that
have been dead ever since I can remember, and are all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
rotten inside, and yet the bark looks as though it was
alive.”</p>

<p>“That is because this oil in the bark preserves it
from decay. And there is another curious thing about
this tree—it is generally the first to spring up after a
forest has been cut down, or burned over. I suppose
most of these birches that we see around us, have
grown up since the pines were cut down. They are
not at all particular about their location, but will manage
to flourish wherever they can find a standing place.
They seem to take it for granted that a birch tree is
better than no tree, and so they squeeze in and fill up
the spaces in the forests, and settle down upon all unappropriated
tracts. And in fact they are not to be
despised; for they grow rapidly, are rather pretty, and
are not only useful to tanners and school-masters, but
their branches make strong withes, when green, and
their wood makes good fuel, when seasoned.”</p>

<p>“Quite a catalogue of virtues,” remarked Clinton.</p>

<p>“Yes—and here we are, almost at Uncle Tim’s,
nearly half through our journey,” added Mr. Davenport.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span></p>

<p>Mr. Lewis, or “Uncle Tim,” as he was always called,
was an old pioneer, who settled down in this wilderness
years ago, his “clearing” being many miles distant
from any neighbor. This was the last house they
would meet, on the road to the camp, and as Uncle
Tim’s dwelling was a sort of tavern, at which all travellers
over the road were accustomed to stop, Mr.
Davenport had determined to rest Fanny there until
the next morning.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE CLEARING.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Uncle Tim</span> was very glad to see Mr. Davenport
and Clinton, as he always was to see travellers. He
called Bill, one of his boys, to go and put up the horse,
while he led the strangers into the house, where his wife
had already set about preparing something for them to
eat, for it was past noon, and the family had just finished
their dinner.</p>

<p>Clinton soon slipped outside, to take a look at the
premises, for his curiosity was much excited by the
novel appearance of things. The clearing was very
large, and not a native tree had been left upon it; but
it was completely surrounded by a straight, unbroken
line of forest, which looked like a perpendicular wall.
The land consisted of gentle slopes and valleys, and
was divided into separate fields, by fences made of
stumps and logs. Nearly in the centre of the clearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
stood the house and barn. They were both built of
spruce logs, placed one upon another, cob-house fashion,
the chinks between them being filled up with clay and
moss. From the centre of the house rose a huge stone
chimney. The windows were glazed in the common
manner. As Clinton was looking around, Uncle Tim
came out and spoke to him:—</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="i_b199" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b199.jpg" alt="The log house">
</figure>
<br>

<p>“What do you think of it, young man?” he said;
“do you suppose you could build as good a house as
this, with nothing but an axe?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span></p>

<p>“I guess not,” replied Clinton; “but you didn’t
build it with an axe, did you?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t have much of anything else to work with,
I assure you,” said Uncle Tim. “There’s no knowing
what you can do with an axe, until you set out and
try. But come in—I guess your dinner’s about
ready.”</p>

<p>Uncle Tim guessed right. The table was covered
with tempting food, in great profusion, and Clinton
and his father sat down to it with a good appetite.</p>

<p>“You don’t starve yourselves, up here in the
woods,” said Mr. Davenport, glancing at the heaping
dishes.</p>

<p>“No,” said Uncle Tim, “we can generally find something
to eat; but it’s a pity you didn’t come along
a little sooner, so as to have had some of our dinner.”</p>

<p>But the travellers did not pity themselves, if Uncle
Tim did; for with the fried ham and eggs, the nice
wheaten bread, the delicious milk, the sweet cakes and
mountain cranberry sauce, the rich cheese, and tea
sweetened with molasses, they were in no danger of
starving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>After their meal, Clinton renewed his examination
of the house; and Uncle Tim seeing he was interested
in it, began to tell him how he built it. He pitched
upon the spot about twenty years before; and after
securing his title, he took his axe and went to work
cutting down trees. The first trees he felled, he used
in building a “camp,” a hut made of logs and covered
with bark. After he had cleared about an acre, and
lopped off the limbs of the fallen trees, he set them on
fire in the fall. The logs, which remained unconsumed,
were afterwards cut into lengths of ten or twelve feet,
piled together in heaps, and again set on fire. Thus
he had burned hundreds of cords of wood, to get rid of
it, which would have sold for six or seven dollars a cord,
could he have sent it to Portland or Boston. In the
spring he planted his corn and potatoes, and then went
to work again with his axe and cleared another piece.
By-and-by he began to feel lonesome, for thus far he
had been entirely alone, with the exception of a couple
of trusty dogs; so he went back to the town from
which he came, married a wife, and then returned to
his home in the forest. After a while their family began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
to increase, and so they built a larger and better house,—the
one in which they were now sitting.</p>

<p>This was the substance of Uncle Tim’s story, although
he made a much longer one of it than I have done;
for it was not very often that he saw a stranger, and
when he did, his tongue was pretty sure to enjoy a
holiday,—not of rest, but of action.</p>

<p>By this time, Mrs. Lewis had cleared off the table,
and Clinton was not a little astonished to see it suddenly
converted into a rude but capacious arm-chair!
The round top of the table was turned up against the
wall, thus forming the back of the chair; and the
frame which supported it, became the arms. The object
of this was to economize space as well as furniture,—for
in log houses there is seldom any room to
waste upon useless articles.</p>

<p>There were five rooms, but the partitions, instead of
being of plastering, were made of wood. Clinton, noticing
this, said:—</p>

<p>“I thought you said you built this house with an
axe; but how did you make your boards for the doors,
and partitions, and floors?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</span></p>

<p>“Boards? Why, bless you, there isn’t a board in
the house. These things are splints, not boards. I
made them by splitting spruce logs. The roof is
covered with them, too, and I’m going to clapboard
the house with the same things afore next winter.”</p>

<p>Clinton’s mistake was very natural, for the floor and
partitions were almost as smooth and straight as
though made of sawed and planed boards. Clinton
noticed in the floor, however, a great number of small
holes, which Uncle Tim told him were made by the
spikes that the drivers fix upon their boots to prevent
their slipping off the logs. This led Clinton to another
discovery. The river, to whose head waters they were
going, passed through Uncle Tim’s clearing; but as it
was frozen over, and the ice partially covered with
snow, Clinton had not noticed it before. It was down
this river that the logs and their iron-shod drivers
came, and the latter were in the habit of stopping at
uncle Tim’s for supplies.</p>

<p>Seeing a noble looking dog asleep in the chimney-corner,
Clinton inquired if that was one of the two
that came with him when he first settled in the woods.</p>

<p>“No,” said Uncle Tim, “but he’s a son of theirs, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
a worthy successor he is, too,—aint you, Hunter?”
Hunter, at the mention of his name, started from his
doze, and wagged his bushy tail, which said “Yes,” as
plain as tail could speak. “He considers the poultry
under his charge,” continued Uncle Tim, “just as his
father and mother did afore him, and he wont suffer a
hawk or any big bird to come within twenty rods of
the chickens. He’s great on Ingins, too,—he smells
’em a mile off, and barks long afore they’re in sight.”</p>

<p>“Do you have many Indians about here?” inquired
Clinton.</p>

<p>“Not many; a few stragglers come along once in a
while. Red-skins aint so plenty as they were when I
first came here, nor half so saucy either. They know
it’s their fate to give way to their betters, and it makes
them sort of humble like.”</p>

<p>Clinton now went out to the barn, where he found
two stout, hearty lads, larger than himself, giving the
cattle their suppers. These were Uncle Tim’s sons.
“Bill” and “Jim” were the only names by which he
heard them called. Their faces were brown, their
hands large and rough, and their clothing was of the
coarsest description; but their bodies were finely developed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
and, like their father, they were shrewd and
intelligent, though they had never enjoyed a day’s
schooling. Clinton took hold and helped them about
their work, and soon he felt very well acquainted with
them. They asked him a great many questions about
Brookdale, and he, in return, was quite as inquisitive
about their home. He was astonished to learn, as he
did, in the course of the conversation, that Bill, the
eldest of these great, broad-shouldered, wide-chested,
and long-legged boys, was only about a year older than
himself, while Jim was actually his junior by three
months. Hard work, constant exposure to the air, and
hearty food, had hastened their growth to a remarkable
degree.</p>

<p>The barn was larger than the house, and was built
in much the same way, though there were only wooden
shutters to the windows instead of glass, and the wood
generally was not so smoothly finished as it was in the
house. The stock consisted of horses, cows, oxen,
pigs and hens. The ground served as a floor, in the
lower story; but overhead there was a loft, in which
hay, straw, and other articles were stored. Clinton
learned from the boys, that their father raised all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
hay and grain necessary for the stock. Potatoes, grass,
and oats, were their principal crops, but they generally
had small patches of wheat and Indian corn. There
were a few apple trees, which Uncle Tim had raised
from the seed, but the boys said the fruit was sour and
crabbed, fit only for “sarse,” or the pigs.</p>

<p>When Clinton returned to the house, he found preparations
making for supper. The fire-place,—the
only one the house could boast,—was almost large
enough to admit of roasting an ox whole; and the
heap of burning logs, four feet long and unsplit, looked
as if Mrs. Lewis was intending to accomplish some
such feat. But it was only her ordinary fire, such as
she always had to boil the tea-kettle, and bake a pan
of cakes. The fire-place was built of stone, and there
was a hearth of the same material before it. An iron
crane swung over the fire, from which the tea-kettle
and baking kettle were suspended, by hooks shaped
like the letter S. Near the ceiling, over the hearth, a
string was stretched across the room, on which a few
stockings were drying.</p>

<p>The arm-chair was now converted into a table, and
supper was soon ready. It was very similar to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
meal of which Mr. Davenport and Clinton had already
partaken. Uncle Tim’s two boys did not come to the
table until the others had risen, as there was not room
enough for all. After the boys had finished their supper,
Clinton asked them if they would not go down
with him to the river. They complied with his request,
and as they were on their way, they passed
some logs, by the side of which there was an axe, with
a remarkably long helve or handle.</p>

<p>“Hullo,” said Clinton, “I guess that axe was made
for a giant.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Bill, “the helve has to be long so that
the chopper can stand on the log when he cuts, so
fashion,” and he jumped upon the log, and gave it two
or three blows that made it crack to the centre.</p>

<p>Clinton found the river narrower than he expected,
and as the snow had drifted in, there was not much ice
to be seen. The boys told him, however, that in the
spring the stream was two or three times as wide and
deep as it was now, and they described to him its lively
appearance in a freshet, when thousands of logs were
swept down its swift current, every day, and the jolly
drivers were continually passing, to start off those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
timbers that happened to lodge against the rocks or
shores.</p>

<p>“I’m going to be a logger,” said Bill; “they have
first-rate times up in the woods, in the winter, and it’s
real fun to see them go down the river in the spring.”</p>

<p>“Poh,” said Jim, “I’ll bet you’ll get enough of it
in one season. Father says it’s the hardest life a fellow
can choose.”</p>

<p>“And what do you mean to be, Jim?” inquired
Clinton.</p>

<p>“I want to be a carpenter,” replied Jim, “but father
wont get me any tools, nor let me go away to learn the
trade. Do you have any tools where you live, Clinton?”</p>

<p>“Yes, lots of them. My father used to be a carpenter,
and has got a whole set of tools, and lets me
use them as much as I please.”</p>

<p>“O, how I wish I had some tools,” continued Jim.
“I mean to ask father to let me go over and see yours
some time.”</p>

<p>“I wish he would let you go,” said Clinton. “I’d
show you all our tools, and how to use them, too.”</p>

<p>Night was fast drawing on, and the boys had now<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
reached the house, where they found Uncle Tim and
Mr. Davenport talking about the elections. There
was in the room an article of furniture called a settle,
a bench large enough for three or four to sit upon, with
a high back, and arms to lean upon at each end.
Clinton did not notice this particularly as it stood in
the back part of the room; but when the boys moved
it up to the fire, and all three seated themselves upon
it, he was much pleased with it.</p>

<p>“Father,” he said, during a pause in the conversation,
“I wish we had one of these seats—don’t you
suppose I could make one?”</p>

<p>“I think very likely you could,” replied Mr. Davenport.</p>

<p>“I mean to try, when I get home,” added Clinton,
and he examined it still more carefully, to see how it
was constructed.</p>

<p>“That settle was my grand-father’s, Master Clinton,” said
Uncle Tim, “and you must see if you can’t
make one that will last as long as that has—then
your grand-children will have something to remember
you by.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try,” said Clinton, with a laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>“‘I’ll try’—those are good words, my boy,” said
Uncle Tim. “That’s what Col. Miller said, when
Gen. Brown asked him if he could carry Queenstown
Heights. ‘I’ll try,’ said he, and sure enough he did
try, and gained a splendid victory, and Congress gave
him a gold medal, with ‘I’ll try’ engraved on it. So
you stick to that motto, Master Clinton, and I guess
your grand-children will have a settle to remember you
by—don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>Clinton laughed, and seeing Uncle Tim was in so
pleasant a mood, he asked him if he wouldn’t let Jim
go over to see him, some time. Jim, finding the ground
was broken, lost no time in putting in a word for himself;
and as Mr. Davenport said he should like to
have the boys visit Clinton, Uncle Tim gave a sort of
half promise that Jim should go, some time when he
could spare him.</p>

<p>The rest of the evening was spent in listening to
Uncle Tim’s stories of his early life in the woods. He
related many interesting accounts of his adventures
with bears and wolves, and other savage animals,
which were then more numerous than now. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span>
of his anecdotes, which greatly amused Clinton, was as
follows:—</p>

<p>“Now I’m going to tell you a story,” said Uncle
Tim, “that happened a good many years ago, up in
Vermont. I guess it was afore I was born, but never
mind, it may be just as new to you, for all that. There
were three brothers that went from Massachusetts and
settled close together in the wilderness, up there. They
all lived in one log hut, and ate out of the same porringer,
but each fellow had his own patch of land, and
as it was pleasanter being together than alone, they
agreed to take turns in working upon each other’s
farms. One day, all hands worked on Jake’s farm, the
next day on Sam’s, and the next on Bill’s—perhaps
I haven’t got the names right, but never mind that.
But by-and-by one of them got sort of jealous, or dissatisfied,
or something of that kind, and said he would
not work that way any longer, no how. So the other
two stuck together, and let the odd sheep do as he
pleased. Well, one day, while the two that agreed
were working in the field, they heard a tremendous
outcry from the other brother’s lot. So they up and
seized their rifles, which they always kept right under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
their noses, and ran to see what the matter was. They
expected to see some horrible sight, you know, but
what do you suppose they found? Why, there was
their brother up in a little sapling, rocking to and fro,
and bellowing with all his might, and below was a
great bear, looking up dreadful earnest at him. It
seems the bear came suddenly at him, and as he
hadn’t time to go after his rifle, he sprung to the
nearest sapling, which he knew the bear couldn’t
climb. But the sapling was so slender it bent over
like a bow, bringing him in such a position that he had
to hold on with both his feet and hands, and the bent
part of his body, which was covered with his buckskin
breeches, hung down almost within reach of the
bear. Old Bruin soon discovered this, and so stood up
on his hind legs, to see if he couldn’t reach him that
way; but all he could do was to give the fellow a push
with his fore paw, which set him and his sapling to
swinging back and forth. His claws did not go
through the buckskin breeches, but the man thought
he was a gone case, and roared dreadfully. The bear
then squatted on his haunches to enjoy the sport, and
when the force of the blow was spent, and the man<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span>
began to get steady, he up and gave him another start.
When the other two fellows saw the state of the case,
they laughed about as loud as their brother hollered,
and it was some time afore they could steady their
hands so as to put a bullet into the bear. After that
scrape all three of them hitched horses together again
and went to work on the old plan. The old bear paid
dear for his sport, but you can’t say he didn’t do some
good in the world, can you? If it hadn’t been for
him, just as likely as not the fuss among those brothers
would have grown bigger and bigger, until they
quarrelled just like cats and dogs.”</p>

<p>At nine o’clock, Uncle Tim wound up his yarns, and
soon after all retired to bed. They ascended to the
second floor by means of a ladder. There were two
bed-rooms, with a space between them, which served
both as an entry and a store room. The great chimney
came up through this entry. Each bed-room had
one window, in the gable end of the house, but the
space between the rooms was dark, except when the
chamber doors were open. The roof came down
nearly to the floor, on each side, and in the centre of
the rooms, a tall man could hardly stand erect. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
Davenport and Clinton slept in one of these rooms,
and Bill and Jim in the other. Uncle Tim and his
wife had a bed-room down stairs. A straw bed made
up upon the floor, without a bedstead, a large chest, and
one chair, were the only furniture in the room where
Clinton slept. There were several long wooden pegs
driven into the logs which served as rafters, upon
which they hung their clothing; and soon both were
sleeping as sweetly as though they had been quartered
in the best room of a “first-class hotel.”</p>

<span class="fs80">THE LOGGERS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> sun rose clear, the next morning, and after an
early and bountiful breakfast, Mr. Davenport and
Clinton bid good-bye to Uncle Tim and his family, and
resumed their journey. The country through which
they rode was much the same as that they had already
passed over, with the exception that it was if possible
even more stern and wild, not a single house or cultivated
spot meeting their eyes during the whole forenoon’s
ride. After the first hour, Clinton was not quite
as lively as usual. In fact, he felt a trifle less cheerful
than ordinary—he could not tell whether it sprang
from a touch of home-sickness, or from a sense of
lonesomeness. But his unpleasant feelings arose
more from the influence of the dreary winter scenery
upon his mind, than from either of these causes. His
father, noticing this, chatted away in a more lively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
strain than usual, and after awhile succeeded in dispelling
the tinge of gloom from his mind.</p>

<p>The road being travelled but very little, the sleighing
was poor, and there was no prospect of their
reaching their destination before the middle of the afternoon.
Accordingly, about noon, they reined up, for
the purpose of resting the horse, and eating their dinner.
Having given Fanny a wisp of hay, to take up
her mind, they collected together a heap of dead wood,
the remnants of fallen trees, etc., which they found
near the road, and set it on fire. It burned finely, and
sent out a cheerful warmth, in which they seated themselves,
and partook with a keen relish of the various
good things which Clinton’s mother had stowed away
in the sleigh-box.</p>

<p>After halting about an hour at this place, they resumed
their journey, and a ride of about three hours
brought them within hearing of the loggers. The
first indication they had that they were near the camp,
was the loud “Gee, haw-buck, whoa!” of a man who
was driving oxen. These sounds had a very enlivening
effect upon Clinton, who could scarcely refrain
from jumping from his seat, and running ahead, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
impatient was he to see some signs of humanity in the
dreary wilderness. But in a few moments, they came
in sight of the camp, and soon they noticed two or
three men, with long hair and immense whiskers, approaching
them from different directions. Mr. Davenport
recognized an old acquaintance in one of them,
and received a most hearty welcome from him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Jones,” said Mr. Davenport, “my boy has long
wanted to see how the loggers live; and as I had a
little leisure and the weather and sleighing were
promising, I thought I would gratify his wishes.”</p>

<p>“I am right glad to see you, and him, too,” said Mr.
Jones; and he seized Clinton by the hand, and gave
it a gripe and a shake which he felt for ten minutes
afterward;—“why, I haven’t laid eyes on a child or
a youngster, for four months, and it’s a real treat to
see you, I can tell you. I’ve got a boy of my own,
at home, about your size, and a fine little fellow he is,
too. I’m afraid you’ll find rather poor quarters here
in the camp, but you are welcome to such accommodations
as we have, just so long as you’ll stay.”</p>

<p>The horse was taken from the sleigh and led to the
cattle hut, and Mr. Jones conducted Mr. Davenport and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
Clinton to one of the camps, where he told them to
make themselves at home. He offered them food,
which they declined until the usual supper-hour. He
had many questions to ask concerning what was going
on in the world, from which the loggers are almost
shut out; and as he and Mr. Davenport were absorbed
in their conversation, Clinton slipped out to reconnoitre
the premises.</p>

<p>The camp, he found, was situated in the midst of the
woods; and not, as he expected to find it, in a clearing.
There was no scenery at all; the tall trees shut out
the prospect on every side, and the only opening for
the eye was towards the clear, blue heavens above.
Only a few trees had been cut down, to serve as material
for the houses, or as fuel. This spot was chosen
for the sake of the shelter it afforded in severe weather,
and also, because there was an excellent spring of water
convenient to it.</p>

<p>Clinton now turned his attention to the camps.
These were built of logs, but in a style much inferior
to Uncle Tim’s house, in the clearing. As they are but
temporary affairs, the loggers only aim at making them
habitable for one or two winters. There were three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
of these buildings, one of which was used by the oxen.
They were each about twenty feet long by fifteen wide
and were built of logs placed one on the top of another,
and the whole sides and roof covered with bark. Each
camp had one door, but no windows. A hole in the
middle of the roof, three or four feet square, served
both for a chimney and a window.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp85" id="i_b219" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b219.jpg" alt="The loggers’ camp">
</figure>
<br>

<p>Clinton now returned to the camp, where his father
and Mr. Jones were sitting, and began to inspect the
interior. He found there were no partitions,—for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
loggers have no occasion for more than one room. The
principal feature of the interior was the fire-place.
This was directly under the hole in the roof, and was
about six feet in diameter. The ground had been dug
out nearly two feet deep, to make a bed for the fire
and ashes, and the space was surrounded by stones.
Benches, made of split logs, were arranged around the
fire, which served both as seats and tables. He noticed
that the door had a wooden latch, which was very
ingeniously whittled to resemble an iron one. The
only other articles in the room were a pork barrel,
water bucket, basin, dipper, towel, a few cooking and
eating utensils, and a dozen greasy and well-worn
books and newspapers. The floor was thickly strewn
with leaves of arbor vitæ, especially under the eaves,
which came down to within three feet of the ground.
These formed the loggers’ beds.</p>

<p>Such was the rude house in which Clinton was to
spend two or three nights. He afterwards found that
it differed from the cattle hut only in having a fire-place,
and an outlet through the roof. But that fire-place,
with the “rousing fire” which it afforded at all
hours of the day and night, made the hovel comparatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
cheerful and comfortable. So far from feeling
disappointed with his quarters, Clinton longed for bed-time
to come, that he might enjoy the new sensation
of sleeping in such a romantic place.</p>

<p>At sunset, the men began to return from their work.
They all wore coarse but warm and durable clothing,
and one article seemed universal among them, namely,
red flannel shirts. Their beards and hair had not been
trimmed since they left home. As they arrived at
their quarters, they flocked around Mr. Davenport and
Clinton, as if a strange face was a very unusual sight
among them, as, indeed, it was. When they had all
returned from their work, Clinton counted twenty men
and six yoke of oxen.</p>

<p>Having washed their faces and hands, the men now
commenced preparations for supper, in both camps. It
was fast growing dark, but they had no lamps, the blazing
fire lighting up their houses very brilliantly. Kettles
of water were boiled, and tea was made. Presently,
one of the men began to poke round in the ashes and
coals, and soon drew forth a large baking-kettle, which
had been buried there two hours before. On taking
off the cover, a huge loaf of bread presented itself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
which even an accomplished housewife might have
been proud to own, so far as appearance was concerned.
This, with a few slices of boiled salt pork,
and tea sweetened with molasses and without milk,
constituted their supper. They had no butter, but
spread molasses on their bread, instead. Clinton ate
heartily of the homely fare. The bread proved quite
as nice as it looked, and even the tea tasted pleasantly
to him. Mr. Davenport emptied what remained of
the contents of the baskets which his wife had stowed
away in the sleigh-box, saying that he would exchange
his cakes and pies for a little of their bread, when he
started for home. He and Clinton had consumed but
a small part of their provisions, and this disposal of the
surplus appeared to gratify the loggers very much, as
they had not tasted of any luxuries of this kind for
many a day.</p>

<p>After supper, the men gathered around the fire, on
the benches, and talked, and told stories, until nearly
ten o’clock, when one after another began to creep
away to his bed of leaves, and stretch himself out,
with his feet towards the fire. Clinton and his father
soon followed their example, and extended themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
upon the soft leaves, without removing their clothing.
The novelty of their position, the crackling and glare
of the fire, and the breathing and snoring of a dozen
strong men, did not permit either of them to sleep
much during the first part of the night. Clinton lay
for more than two hours, at times watching the stars
through the opening in the roof, and then gazing steadfastly
at the flickering fire and the curling smoke
spangled with sparks. But at last he fell asleep,
though he awoke again, several times, before morning.
Occasionally, one of the men, who happened to awake,
would get up and put a fresh log upon the fire, which
is kept burning by night as well as by day.</p>

<p>By sunrise, the next morning, the men in both
camps had despatched their breakfasts, and turned
out the oxen, and were ready to commence the day’s
work. Mr. Davenport and Clinton determined to accompany
them to the scene of their operations, which
was a short distance from the camp, and spread over a
considerable extent of ground. The men did not all
work together, but after proceeding a little way, they
separated into three different gangs. The choppers, or
those who cut down the trees, formed one party, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
proceeded by themselves to their particular spot.
Another gang were called swampers. It was their
business to clear roads from the felled trees to the landing
place on the banks of the river, where the logs remain
until the breaking up of the ice in the spring,
when they are rolled into the water. The third party
were teamsters, whose business it was to haul the logs
from the forest to the stream. These last had the assistance
of the oxen, which were attached to little “bobsleds,” as
they were called, upon which the heavy end
of the log was placed, while the other dragged upon
the snow.</p>

<p>Clinton had abundant time to witness the operations
of all these gangs, during the day. He found there
was not much of either novelty or variety, in their labors,
which in fact differed but little from the routine
of the wood-chopper, which he had often witnessed at
home. The sturdy strokes of the choppers, followed
by the falling of the noble tree,—the stripping of the
prostrate trunk of its branches,—the clearing of a
passage way for the oxen through the small growth,
and the hauling of the log to the river’s bank, were by
no means novel sights to him. At the landing-place he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
found hundreds of logs piled up, awaiting the opening
of the river. Each log had a peculiar and uniform
mark cut in the sap-wood, by an axe, somewhat resembling
a crow’s foot, by which the owner would be
enabled to know it when it should reach the great
boom far away down the river, and become mixed up
with thousands of other logs, belonging to many different
persons. Each owner has his own private mark
or device, which is bored or cut into all his logs, and
thus he is always able to distinguish them from those
of other lumber-men.</p>

<p>Clinton kept with the loggers all day, witnessing
their operations, and asking questions about their business.
Indeed, he did not dare to go far from them, for
fear of getting lost in the woods. At sunset, he returned
with them from their labors, and after the
homely evening meal, he sat and listened to the stories
of the loggers, until bed-time. These stories were
mostly of encounters with bears and wolves in the
wilderness, of hunting excursions, and of adventures
and exploits in the logging-camp and upon the river.
One of the oldest and most intelligent of the men related
the following adventure, in answering some inquiries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
of Clinton concerning the manner of driving
logs to mill:—</p>

<p>“Six years ago,” said he, “I was logging upon the
head waters of the Penobscot. “We cut eight thousand
logs; and about the last of April we started them downstream.
It took two or three days to roll them all in,
and by that time, some of those we started first were
perhaps more than fifty miles down stream, while
others had lodged within a hundred rods of us. So
we divided into three gangs, one to descend by boats,
and the others by land each side of the stream. Each
man was provided with a pole, having a stout hook in
the end, and with these we pushed off the logs, where
ever we found they had lodged on the banks or rocks.
The first few days, we made pretty good progress,
having little to do but to roll in the logs, and set
them afloat merrily down the river.”</p>

<p>“Did you camp at nights, as you do here?” inquired
Clinton.</p>

<p>“Yes, we camped out, but we had nothing but little
huts made of spruce boughs, where we ate and slept;—as
I was saying,—all went on pretty easy at first,
and some days we got over fifteen or twenty miles of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
ground. But by-and-by we came to a jam. Do you
know what a jam is?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well, when the river gets choked up with logs
which have met with some obstruction, we call it a
jam. Sometimes, a thousand logs will accumulate in
this way, forming a sort of dam across the river, and interrupting
the flow of the water. And, oftentimes, all
this is occasioned by a single log catching upon a projecting
rock; and if that single log could be started,
the whole mass would go down stream with a tremendous
rush.”</p>

<p>“I should think that would be fine sport,” said
Clinton.</p>

<p>“It’s all very fine to look at,” continued the logger;
“but you wouldn’t think there was much sport about
it, if you had to go out upon this immense raft, and
loosen the logs, at the risk of being ground to atoms
by them when they start.”</p>

<p>“Are people ever killed in that way?” inquired
Clinton.</p>

<p>“Not very often; for none but the most experienced
drivers are allowed to undertake such a delicate job;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
and they are always very cautious how they proceed.
But let me go on with my story: the jam I was telling
you about, happened to be in a rapid, rocky place,
where the river passed through a narrow gorge. On
each side were steep cliffs, more than sixty feet high,
which almost hung over the water. The only way to
reach the jam was to descend by a rope from one of
these cliffs. This was so hazardous an undertaking,
that we concluded to wait a day or two, to see if the
choked up mass wouldn’t clear itself, by its own
pressure, and thus save us all trouble and danger.
But after waiting nearly two days, there were no signs
of the jam’s breaking. We can generally tell when
this is going to happen, by the swaying of the logs;
but the mass was as firm and compact as ever; and it
was evident that we must do something to start it.
There was an old and very expert driver in our gang,
who offered to descend to the jam, and see what could
be done. So we rigged a sort of crane, and lowered
him down from the cliff by means of a rope fastened
around his body, under his arms. After he had looked
around a little, he sung out to us that he had discovered
the cause of the trouble. A few strokes of the axe in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
a certain place, he said, would start the jam; and he
cautioned us to pull him up, gently, as soon as he
should cry, ‘Pull!’ and also to be careful, and not
jerk him against the precipice. He then began to hew
into the log which was the cause of the jam. After
he had worked a few minutes, the mass began to heave
and sway, and he cried out, ‘Pull!’ As the spot
where he had been chopping was near the centre of the
stream, he started instantly towards the cliff, so that
his rope should be perpendicular. But before he could
put himself in the right position for being drawn up,
the huge mass of logs rose up in a body, and then, with
a crash, rolled away in every direction from under his
feet. The scene was awful. Some of the logs plunged
headlong down the rapids, with tremendous force; others
leaped entirely out of the water, turning complete
somersets, end over end; others were hurled crosswise
upon each other, or dashed madly together by hundreds,
or were twisted and twirled about, in a most fearful
manner. At the first movement of the jam, our man
was plunged into the water. For a moment, we were
horror-struck, but we pulled away at the rope, expecting
to draw up only a mangled and lifeless body.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</span>
And we should have done so, had we been half a
second later; for we had just raised the man out of
the water, when a mass of seventy-foot logs swept by,
directly under him, with force enough to have broken
every bone in his body, had he been in their way. He
suffered no harm but his ducking and fright. But I
don’t believe he will ever forget that day’s adventure.
So, my boy, you see it isn’t all sport, driving logs,—though
some think this is the pleasantest part of a
logger’s life.”</p>

<p>“How do you stop the logs, when they have gone as
far as you want them to go?” inquired Clinton.</p>

<p>“They are stopped by great booms, built of logs, and
bolted and chained together very strong. These booms
are rigged across the river, so that the floating logs cannot
pass them. The great boom at Old Town, near
Bangor, where our drive brought up, that year, had
over a million of logs in it, when we got down there,
seven weeks after we started from the forests. The
logs lay upon one another about ten feet deep, and extended
back for miles. They belonged to hundreds of
different men and companies, but as each had its own
mark, there was no difficulty in sorting them out. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span>
boom is opened at set times, to let out a portion of the
logs, and then the river below is all alive with men
and boys, in small boats, who grapple the logs as they
float down, and form them into rafts, or tow them to the
various mills on the river. Very few of the logs escape,
unless too many are let out from the boom at
once, or the river is swollen by a freshet, in which case
they sometimes float off to sea and are lost. But all
hands seem to be going to bed, and I guess we had
better follow their example.”</p>

<p>Upon this, the old logger stretched himself upon the
bed of faded leaves; and Clinton, who for some time
had been his only listener, was soon in the same
position.</p>

<span class="fs80">A TALK IN THE WOODS.</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Early</span> the next morning, Mr. Davenport and
Clinton decided to start for home, as there were indications
of an approaching change in the weather,
which might render the roads very uncomfortable, if it
did not compel them to prolong their stay at the loggers’
camp longer than would be agreeable. After a
breakfast of hot bread and molasses, fried pork, and
tea, Fanny was harnessed, and bidding farewell to
their forest friends, they jumped into the sleigh, and
set their faces towards Brookdale. As they were riding
along the solitary road, Mr. Davenport asked Clinton
if he thought he should like to be a logger.</p>

<p>“I don’t know but I should,” he replied; “there
are a good many things about the business I should
like. It makes them strong and healthy, and I guess
they have good times in the camps, and on the rivers.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
It is quite a romantic life, too, and they seem to meet
with a good many curious adventures.”</p>

<p>“The novelty and romance of it soon wear off,” replied
Mr. Davenport. “These gone, do you think you
should like the business well enough to follow it up
year after year?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, I suppose I should get tired of it,
being away from home so much of the time,” said
Clinton.</p>

<p>“The work is very hard, too,” suggested his father.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“And the pay is not very great, in proportion.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It is, however, a very useful employment,” continued
Mr. Davenport, “and there must be men to engage
in it. It is an honorable employment, too, for all
useful labor is honorable. But I should not call it a
very desirable employment. The logger not only has
to labor very hard, but he must go far away from his
home, and deprive himself of nearly every comfort
of civilized life, and expose himself to many dangers.
And for all this hardship and toil, he does not receive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
so much pay as many a mechanic earns in his shop,
with half the effort.”</p>

<p>“Does not Mr. Preston make a great deal of money
at logging?” inquired Clinton.</p>

<p>“I suppose he makes a fair business of it,” replied
his father; “but he is a contractor, and employs a good
many hands. I was speaking of the hired men, not
of those who manage the business.”</p>

<p>“Is Mr. Jones a contractor?”</p>

<p>“No, he works by the month, and hard work he
finds it, too, I fear.”</p>

<p>“Then why does he follow it?”</p>

<p>“Because he is obliged to. He has a family to
support, and this is the only way by which he can
provide for them. Should you like to know how it
happened that he cannot make money by an easier and
pleasanter method?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Clinton.</p>

<p>“When he and I were boys together,” continued Mr.
Davenport, “his father was rich, but mine was poor.
When I was nine years old, I was taken from school,
and put out to work; but Henry Jones was not only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
kept at school, for many years after, but was not required
to do any work, even in his leisure hours. He
was well dressed, and had everything he wanted, and
I can remember to this day how I used to envy him.
I could not go to school even in winter, but had to
work constantly, and earn my own living. When I
was about fourteen years old, I engaged myself as an
apprentice to a carpenter. I liked the work, and soon
made pretty good progress. As I had the long winter
evenings to myself, it occurred to me that I might
make up for my lack of school privileges, by an improvement
of those leisure hours. So I got some
school books, and set myself to studying. Soon after
I reached my sixteenth year, I offered myself as a
candidate for schoolmaster in our town, and was accepted,
for the winter term, my master having agreed
to release me for three months, as he usually had little
business during that portion of the year. And I, the
poor self-taught boy, was not only a school teacher, but
Henry Jones, whose privileges I had so often envied,
was one of my scholars! A very dull scholar he was,
too, for he did not take the slightest interest in his
studies. Before I had finished my term, he left school,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
against the wishes of his parents, having been fairly
shamed out of it. He remained about home several
months, doing nothing, until his father secured a situation
for him in a merchant’s store in Portland; but
when he made his appearance in the counting-room,
the merchant found him so deficient in penmanship
and arithmetic, that, after a week’s trial, he sent Henry
back to his father, with the message that he would not
answer. His failure discouraged him from attempting
to do anything more. Instead of remedying the defects
in his education, he refused to go to school any
more, but spent his time principally in lounging about
his father’s place of business, and in sauntering around
the town. He was a perfect idler, and as his father
continued to support and clothe him, he took no more
thought for the morrow, than the pigs in our sty do,
and I doubt whether he was half so valuable to the
world as they are.</p>

<p>“But this state of things could not last for ever.
His father had embarked very largely in the famous
eastern land speculations, and when the crash came,
he found himself ruined. And yet even then, Henry
managed to hang upon him like a dead-weight for two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span>
or three years, sponging his living out of his father’s
shattered fortunes. But after a while, his father died,
and then Mr. Jones had to shift for himself. But
what was he fit for? It took him a great while to find
out. He tried several lighter kinds of employment,
but did not succeed. At length a man came along
who was making up a gang of loggers, and despairing
of any better employment, he engaged in that, and has
continued at it ever since. He is with his family only
four or five months in the year, and during that time
he works hard, at farming, not for himself, but as a
hired man.”</p>

<p>“I should think he would feel bad, when he thinks
how he wasted his youth,” said Clinton.</p>

<p>“He does,” said Mr. Davenport. “He is a worthy
and industrious man now, but he cannot repair the
errors of his boyhood. Had he worked half as hard
when a youth as he has had to since, he would probably
be under no necessity of laboring now. But then
his parents were rich and indulgent, and he thought he
should never be obliged to work. Whenever we meet, he
always says, ‘O dear, what a fool I have been! If my
father had only kicked me into the street when I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
twelve years old, and left me to shirk for myself, I
might have been something now.’ And I never see
him, without thanking God that I was brought up to
depend upon myself, from my boyhood.”</p>

<p>Fanny had now come to a long and steep hill, and
Mr. Davenport and Clinton got out and walked up, to
lighten her load. When they reached the top, the
prospect was very extensive, and they stopped a few
minutes, to enjoy the scene, and to rest the horse.
While they were gazing around, Clinton discovered
something moving on a distant hill, and cried out:—</p>

<p>“A deer! a deer! don’t you see it, father?—right
over that great pine that stands all alone, there.”</p>

<p>Mr. Davenport soon discovered the object pointed
out by Clinton, and said:—</p>

<p>“No, that can’t be a deer, Clinty,—it is too large.
It is a moose, and a noble great one, too. I should
like to have a shot at him, but he is too far off.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know there were moose around in this
part of the State,” said Clinton. “One of the loggers
told me they hadn’t seen one this winter.”</p>

<p>“They are pretty scarce now in this section of the
country,” said his father; “but now and then one is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
seen. That fellow has probably been pursued, and has
strayed away from his yard.”</p>

<p>The moose continued in sight for several minutes.
Its gait was a swift, regular trot, which no obstacle
seemed to break. There was something noble in its
bearing, and Clinton stood watching and admiring it,
until it disappeared in the woods. He and his father
then got into the sleigh, and drove on.</p>

<p>“The moose is a handsomer animal than I supposed,”
said Clinton. “That one Mr. Preston brought home,
two or three years ago, was a coarse, clumsy-looking
fellow.”</p>

<p>“They always look so, seen at rest, and close to,”
replied Mr. Davenport. “But when they are in motion,
and at a distance, there is something quite majestic
about them. They travel very fast, and they always
go upon the trot. It makes no difference if they
come to a fence or other obstruction five or six feet
high,—they go right over it, without seeming to break
their trot. I have been told that they will travel
twenty miles an hour, which is almost as fast as our
railroad trains average.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span></p>

<p>“I have heard of their being harnessed into sleds—did
you ever see it done?”</p>

<p>“No, but they are sometimes trained in this way,
and they make very fleet teams. The reindeer, which
are used to draw sleds in some parts of Europe, are
not so strong or so fleet as our moose.”</p>

<p>“It is curious that their great antlers should come
off every year,” said Clinton.</p>

<p>“Yes, and it is even more curious that such an enormous
mass should grow out again in three or four
months’ time. This is about the time of the year that
their new antlers begin to sprout. I saw a pair, once,
that weighed seventy pounds, and expanded over five
feet to the outside of the tips. The moose must have
a very strong neck, to carry this burden about upon
his head. When the antlers are growing, they are
quite soft and sensitive, and the moose is very careful
not to injure them. This is one reason, I suppose,
why they frequent the lakes and rivers in the summer
and autumn, instead of roaming through the forests.
At these seasons of the year, the hunter has only to
conceal himself on the shore of some pond or lake,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span>
and he is pretty sure to fall in with them. But the
best time to hunt them is in the winter or spring, when
they are in their ‘yards,’ as they are called.”</p>

<p>“Did you ever see a moose-yard, father?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw one a good many years ago. A party
of us went back into the forests on a hunting excursion,
one spring, and as near as I can remember, it
was in this very part of the country that we came
across the yard. That was before the loggers came
this way, and frightened away the moose. There were
no roads, then, in this section, and we travelled on foot,
on snow shoes, with our guns in our hands, and our
provisions on our backs. Some hours before we discovered
the yard, we knew we were near one, by the
trees which had been barked by them in the fall.
Having got upon the right track, we followed it up, as
silently as possible, until we came to the yard. But
the moose had heard or smelt us, and vacated their
quarters before we reached them. The yard we found
to be an open space of several acres, with paths running
in every direction, all trodden hard; for the
moose does not break fresh snow, when he can help it.
Nearly all the trees in the vicinity were stripped of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span>
their bark, to the height of eight or ten feet, and the
young and tender twigs were clipped off as smoothly
as if it had been done by a knife. We could not tell
how many moose had yarded here, but from the size
and appearance of their quarters, we judged there
must have been five or six. Sometimes they yard
alone, but generally a male, female and two fawns are
found together. But we did not stop many moments
to examine their quarters. We soon found their track
from the yard, but we could not tell from this how
many there were, for they generally travel single file,
the male going first, and the others stepping exactly
into his tracks. We kept up the pursuit until night,
without catching a sight of our game. We then built
a camp of hemlock boughs, made up a good fire in
front of it, ate our supper, and went to bed.</p>

<p>“We started again early the next morning, and had
not gone much more than half a mile, before we found
the place where the moose had spent the night. Some
how or other, they can tell when their pursuers stop,
and if tired, they improve the opportunity to rest.
Having gone a little farther, the track divided into
two, and our party concluded to do the same. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
several hours’ pursuit, the gang with which I went
came in sight of a moose. He was evidently pretty
stiff, and we gained on him fast, as the thick crust on
the snow, while it aided us, was a great inconvenience
to him. Finding at last that he could not get away
from us, he suddenly turned about, and stood prepared
to meet us. But we had no disposition to form a very
close acquaintance with him. One blow with his fore
feet, or one kick with his hind legs, would have killed
the first man that approached him. But he would not
leave his place to attack us, and so we had nothing to
do but to lodge a bullet or two in his head, which
quickly decided the contest. We took his hide, and as
much of the meat as we could carry, and went back to
meet our companions, who, we found, had followed up
their trail all day without getting sight of any game.
At night they gave up the chase, and returned to the
place at which they had separated from us. That was
my first and last moose hunt. On the whole, we were
as successful as most hunting parties are, for the moose
is a very shy animal, and it is difficult to approach
within sight of it, without its taking alarm.”</p>

<p>Mr. Davenport had scarcely finished his moose story<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
when Uncle Tim’s clearing appeared in sight. As a
storm seemed to be gathering, which might last several
days, he concluded to stop here only long enough for
dinner, and then to push his way homeward. Uncle
Tim and his wife and boys were glad to see him and
Clinton, and they seemed quite disappointed when
they found their guests were not going to stop over
night. After an hour’s visit, the travellers resumed
their journey, and arrived home early in the evening,
without any remarkable adventure. The storm which
Mr. Davenport anticipated, set in about dark, in the
form of rain and sleet, and continued for two or three
days. This kept Clinton in the house, much of the
time, and gave him an opportunity to relate to his
mother and Annie the various incidents of his excursion,
which he did with great minuteness and fidelity.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> days were now perceptibly longer, and the sun
had begun to make quite an impression on the huge
snow-banks in which Brookdale had been nearly buried
up all winter. “Bare ground,” that looks so pleasant
to the boy in a northern climate, after a long winter,
began to appear in little brown patches, in particularly
sunny and sheltered spots. The ice upon the pond
was still quite thick, but it was too soft and rough for
skating. The sled runners cut in so deeply, that there
was little fun in sliding down hill. Besides, skating
and coasting had got to be old stories, and the boys
were heartily tired of all their winter sports. The
sleighing was about spoiled, the roads were sloppy,
the fields and meadows impassable, and the woods uncomfortable.
In fact, while all the outdoor amusements
of winter were at an end, it was too early for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
various summer games and sports that supply their
places. This brief season, which usually attends the
breaking up of winter in northern latitudes, is generally
the dullest of all the year to boys in the country,
unless they are so fortunate as to be able to amuse
themselves indoors, a part of the time at least.</p>

<p>Clinton’s favorite place of resort, at such seasons,
was the shop in the rear of the house. Here, surrounded
with tools, and patterns, and plans, and specimens
of his own work, and perhaps absorbed by some
object upon which he was engaged, he was never at a
loss for amusement. A day or two after his return
from the logging camp, he went to work on the
“settle,” which he had determined to make, in imitation
of the one he had seen at Uncle Tim’s. This was
a job that would require some little thinking and planning,
as well as skill at handling tools,—for his
mother had promised to give it a place in the kitchen,
if it was well made,—and he felt anxious to do his
best on this occasion. He first sawed out from a plank
the two end pieces, rounding off one corner of each,
in a sort of long scroll pattern. Having planed these
smooth, he next made the seat, which was also of stiff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span>
plank, and fastened it firmly in its place. Nothing remained
to be done but to make the back, which was of
boards, planed and matched, and screwed into the end
pieces. In the course of a week the settle was finished;
and it was not only neat and well-finished, but really
substantial. It looked as though it might do service
full as long as Uncle Tim’s. Clinton was quite satisfied
with his success, and his mother was so well
pleased with the settle, that she not only decided to
place it in the kitchen, but promised to make a handsome
cushion for it.</p>

<p>As Clinton was looking admiringly upon his piece of
work, soon after it was finished, and thinking whether
he could improve it in any respect, the conversation at
Uncle Tim’s recurred to his mind, and a happy thought
suggested itself, by which he might associate his settle
with that interview, and thus have constantly before
him a memorial of his trip to the loggers. The next
time he had occasion to go to the store, he bought a
small package of brass-headed tacks, and with these
he carried out his new design, which was to inscribe
his initials “C. D.” upon one end of the settle, and the
motto, “<span class="smcap">I’ll Try</span>,” upon the other. He had seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
nails arranged in the form of letters upon trunks, and
he found no difficulty in making his inscriptions look
very well. He surrounded each of them by a single
line of tacks, placed in the form of an oval, which
gave the whole
quite a finished
look. This improvement
elicited
from his parents
many additional
compliments
for the new article of furniture.</p>

<p>The snow was rapidly disappearing, and the sunny
sides of the hills were quite bare. The welcome song
of the robin was heard around the house, proclaiming
the arrival of spring. The brook which flowed through
Mr. Davenport’s land was swelled to a miniature torrent,
and Clinton’s ducks,—whose water privileges
had been restricted through the winter to a small space
kept clear of ice by an axe,—now sailed about in all
their glory. The frost soon left the ground,—for it
penetrates but slightly, when the earth is covered with
snow all winter,—the moisture rapidly dried up, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
the fields were ready for the plough. For a few weeks
Clinton was employed, much of the time, in the various
labors of the farm. He usually drove the ploughing
team, but he sometimes turned the furrow, by way of
change, while his father guided the oxen. Then came
harrowing, manuring, planting, setting out trees, making
beds in the kitchen-garden, and the various other farm
operations of spring, in all of which Clinton assisted
his father. He also attended to his own patch of
ground, of which he had the sole care every year. As
they were at work in the kitchen-garden one day, Mr.
Davenport asked Clinton how he should like to take
the whole charge of it for the season.</p>

<p>“Why, I should think I might take care of it, just as
well as you, after it’s all planted,” replied Clinton.</p>

<p>“And should you be willing to assume all the
trouble and responsibility?” inquired his father.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I’ll take it and do the best I can,—only,
I may want your advice sometimes.”</p>

<p>“Well, Clinty,” resumed his father, “I’ll make you
an offer, and you may accept it or not, just as you
please. After the garden is planted, I will surrender
it entirely into your hands, and you shall do the best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
you can with it. You shall keep account of everything
that is raised in it, and at the end of the season
we will calculate the value of the various crops, and I
will give you one-fourth of the whole sum, as your
share of the profits. For instance, if the vegetables
you raise come to twenty-five dollars, you shall have
six dollars and a quarter for your services. If, by
your good management and the aid of a favorable
season, you raise forty dollars’ worth, you will receive
ten dollars,—and so on in proportion.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do it, I’ll do it,”—said Clinton, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment,” continued Mr. Davenport,—“there
are one or two conditions that must be plainly
understood, before we close the bargain; one is, that
you are not to neglect <em>my</em> work, for the sake of your
own. I shall call on you, when I want your assistance
in the field, just as I did last year, and you
mustn’t think that what you do in your garden is to
exempt you from all further labor. And you must
understand, too, that if I find you are neglecting the
garden at any time, I shall take it back into my own
hands, and you will receive nothing for your labor. Do
you agree to this?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, sir; but you’ll allow me time enough to take
care of the garden, wont you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, you shall have time enough for that, besides
some hours every day, to devote to study and
play.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Clinton, “I’ll agree to all that, and
if the garden doesn’t do well, it shan’t be my fault.”</p>

<p>In a few days the garden was all planted. It was
nearly an acre in extent, and was thickly sowed with
vegetables, such as peas, beans, lettuce, radishes, turnips,
cabbages, onions, early potatoes, sweet corn, cucumbers,
squashes, melons, etc. Having done all that
he was to do with it, Mr. Davenport now surrendered
it into the keeping of Clinton. For a few weeks the
garden required little care; but by-and-by the weeds
began to spring up, and the various insect tribes commenced
their operations among the tender plants.
Clinton now found plenty to do. He was wise enough,
however, not let his work get behind hand; for had
he suffered the bugs and weeds to get a few days’ start
of him, I doubt whether he would have overtaken them.
This was one secret of his success; another was, his
perseverance,—for he generally carried through whatever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span>
he undertook, simply because he was determined
to do so. Mr. Davenport was very well satisfied with
the way he managed the garden; and to encourage
him, he was careful not to call him away to other parts
of the farm any more than was necessary.</p>

<p>Clinton generally rode over to the post-office, at the
Cross-Roads, every Saturday afternoon, to get the
weekly newspapers to which his father was a subscriber.
One pleasant afternoon, in May, he drove over as usual,
and as the mail had not arrived, he hitched Fanny to a
post, and went away, a short distance, to where a group
of small boys of his acquaintance were collected.
They were earnestly and loudly discussing some point,
and when they saw Clinton, one of them said:—</p>

<p>“There’s Clinton Davenport coming, let’s leave it
to him.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” cried one and another,—and the proposition
appeared to be unanimously accepted.</p>

<p>“Well, what is the trouble?” inquired Clinton.</p>

<p>Half a dozen different voices began to answer at
once, when Clinton cut them all short, and told Frank,
one of the oldest boys, to explain the difficulty.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Frank, “you know when we play ‘I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span>
spy,’ we tell off the boy, that’s to lead in the game, in
this way:—</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“‘Tweedledum, twaddledum!’ you goose!” exclaimed
one of the boys; “who ever heard such lingo
as that? This is the right way, isn’t it, Clinton?</p>

    <div class="verse indent1">Stinklam, stanklam, buck.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">There, now, isn’t that right?”</p>

<p>“That’s the way we have it here,” replied Clinton,—“but
I suppose they say it different where Frank
came from. When Oscar Preston was here, he used
to rattle it off different from both of these; I believe
this is the way he said he learned it:—</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Ho! I never heard of that way before,” said one
of the boys; “I guess that’s the latest Boston edition.”</p>

<p>“If you can’t agree on any of these,” said Clinton,
“I’ll tell you what you can do,—you can ‘tell off’
with:—</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Pooh!” said Frank; “that aint right, nor anywhere

<div class="poetry-container">

  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Eeny, meeny, mony, my;</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Pistolanee, bony, sly;</div>
    <div class="verse indent6">Argy, dargy, walk.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The other boys all objected to this version of the saying,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
but Frank insisted that if it was not the right one,
it was certainly the best.</p>

<p>“I wonder who first made up all these poetries,”
said one of the smaller boys.</p>

<p>“‘These poetries!’ what grammar do you study,
Ned?” said Frank, with a laugh.</p>

<p>“Well, you know what I mean,” replied Ned; “I
knew ’t wasn’t right,—I only said it just in fun.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know when these rhymes were made,”
said Clinton, “but my father says they used to have
them when he was young, and I suppose the boys have
always had something of the kind. Shouldn’t you
like to see all the different kinds printed in a book,
Ned?”</p>

<p>“I guess I should,” replied Ned; “what a funny
book it would make!”</p>

<p>The mail-stage had now arrived, and Clinton went
over to the post-office. In addition to the usual newspapers,
the post-master handed him two letters. One
of them was for Mrs. Preston, for Clinton often took
her letters and papers from the post-office, and delivered
them on his way home. The other letter was addressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
to himself. It was stamped at Boston, and
was in the hand-writing of his uncle. The letter for
Mrs. Preston had two or three different post-marks
upon it, and was somewhat dingy, as though it had
travelled a great distance. This, together with the
fact that the address was written in a cramped and
awkward hand, led Clinton to suspect, or at least hope,
it was from Jerry. He hurried back as fast as possible,
and when he reached Mrs. Preston’s, his curiosity
was so much excited that he determined to stop and
hear who the letter was from. He watched Mrs.
Preston as she first glanced at the address, and then
hastily broke the seal, and before she had read half its
contents, he felt so certain that he had guessed right,
that he inquired:—</p>

<p>“Isn’t it from Jerry, Mrs. Preston?”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Preston was too eagerly engaged, to heed
his question, and she continued reading until she had
finished the letter, when she replied:—</p>

<p>“Yes, it is from Jerry, and I’m very much obliged
to you for bringing it. Poor boy! he’s having a hard
time of it, but it’s a great satisfaction to know where
he is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span></p>

<p>“Where is he?” inquired Clinton, whose curiosity
was now thoroughly awakened.</p>

<p>“You may read the letter, if you wish,” said Mrs.
Preston, handing it to Clinton. “Read it aloud, if
you please, so that Emily and Harriet may hear.”</p>

<p>Clinton complied with her request. Correcting the
grammar, spelling, and punctuation, the letter read as
follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">Rio Janeiro, March 30.</span></p>
<p class="no-indent">
“<span class="smcap">Dear Mother</span>,<br>
</p>

<p>I write these few lines to let you know I am alive
and well, and I hope this will find you so. You will
see from the date I am a good ways from home. I
came here in the brig Susan, which sailed from Boston
in February. We have had a very rough time. Last
week we encountered a terrible gale, and I thought it
was a gone case with us. We had to put in here to
repair damages, and as there is a chance to send letters
home I thought I would write. We are bound for
Valparaiso, and have got to go round Cape Horn. It is
a long voyage, and I guess I shall go to California before
I come home. I don’t like going to sea so well
as I expected, and I don’t mean to go another voyage.
It’s a hard life, I can tell you. I am sorry I took that
money, but I had to have some. I didn’t spend but
little of it, but somebody has stolen the rest—some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
the sailors, I suppose, but I don’t know who. I mean
to pay you back again, out of my wages. I suppose
father hasn’t got through logging yet. I should like
to see you all, but I must wait a spell. Tell Mary I
am going to fetch her home a pretty present, and I
shall bring something for the others, too. I can’t see
to write any longer, so good-bye to you all.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="smcap">Jeremiah Preston.</span>”<br>
</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>“Mother,” said Harriet, as soon as Clinton had finished
reading the letter, “what does Jerry mean about
taking money?”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me any questions now,” replied Mrs.
Preston, in a tone that cut off all further inquiries.
Jerry’s theft had been a secret in her own breast, until
now; but as he had alluded to it in his letter, and as
his letter must be read by all the family, she knew it
could no longer be concealed. Still, she was provoked
that Harriet should be so thoughtless as to allude to
the subject in the presence of Clinton.</p>

<p>“Emily,” continued Mrs. Preston, “you run and get
your atlas, and let Clinton show us where Jerry is, before
he goes.”</p>

<p>The atlas was soon produced, and Clinton, turning
to the map of South America, pointed out to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span>
family the location of Rio Janeiro, in Brazil, on the
Atlantic coast, and Valparaiso, the chief sea-port of
Chili, on the Pacific side of the continent. Then, remembering
his own unopened letter, he bade them
good-night, and started for home.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">“Mother,</span> I’ve got lots of news,” said Clinton, as
he entered the house; “Mrs. Preston’s had a
letter from Jerry, and I’ve got one from Uncle Clinton.
Jerry’s gone to sea, and wrote home from Rio
Janeiro. He came near being shipwrecked, and he
says he’s got enough of going to sea. He’s got to go
clear round Cape Horn, though, to Valparaiso, before
he can come home.”</p>

<p>“And what does your Uncle Clinton write?”</p>

<p>“O, I haven’t read that yet, but I’m going to now,”
said Clinton; and he sat down and opened his letter.
“See what a long one it is,” he added, holding it open;
“I wonder what it can all be about.” It was as follows:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">
“<span class="smcap">Boston, May 12, 185-.</span></p>
<p class="no-indent">
“<span class="smcap">My Dear Nephew and Namesake</span>,<br>
</p>

<p>It’s a long while since you have had a letter from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
me, and I suppose you will wonder what is going to
happen when you see this; but don’t be frightened—there’s
nothing alarming in the wind. We all felt
very sorry, when your father wrote us that your anticipated
visit to Boston this spring must be postponed.
Willie, in particular, was sadly disappointed. He had
set his heart on having a nice time with you—piloting
you around the city, showing you the ‘elephants,’ and
making himself generally useful and agreeable. And
will you believe it, the silly fellow actually ‘boo-hooed
right out’ when your father’s letter came, and put a wet
blanket on his anticipations. Well, never mind, you’ll
come this summer or fall, wont you? I’ve promised
Willie you shall, and as I always keep my promises,
you see there is no backing out of that. Tell your
father that he <em>must</em> let you come, as soon as he can
spare you; and if he doesn’t, I shall send a writ after
you.</p>

<p>“I have a case on the docket, as we lawyers say,
that I guess will interest you a little. Willie insists
upon my writing a history of it for your benefit; and
as he is full four feet high, now, and keeps a terrible
great dog, I suppose I must comply with his wishes.
The parties in this case are, on the one side, our venerable
and dignified Commonwealth, and on the other,
that young harum-scarum crony of yours, (if you will
own him as such), Oscar Preston. You knew, I suppose,
that Oscar went to sea after he left Brookdale so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
suddenly, last fall. He got back again in the winter,
perfectly cured of his life-on-the-ocean-wave fever, and
has done nothing but loaf about and cut up shines ever
since. He wouldn’t go to school, and he wouldn’t go
to work, and he wouldn’t do anything that his father
wished him to do.</p>

<p>“But his bad habits were not all negative ones, I
can assure you; for a few weeks ago it happened to
be discovered, some how or other, that he and two or
three other boys had formed a band of thieves, and
had stolen several articles from different persons and
houses. The affair went before the Grand Jury, and
one of the young scamps confessed the whole story.
So an officer arrested Oscar, and carried him to jail;
and his father, on learning the facts in the case, was so
enraged that he would not bail him out. He came to
me, however, to see what could be done for Oscar, and
engaged me to act as his counsel. I inquired into all
the facts, and when I found how conclusive the evidence
was against him, I told his father the best thing
Oscar could do would be to plead guilty, and trust to
the mercy of the judge, who, I had little doubt, would
take into consideration his youth, and sentence him to
the Reform School. His father objected to this at
first, but at last he was convinced that this would be
the best course. So we both went over to the jail,
in Cambridge Street, last week, to talk with Oscar
about it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span></p>

<p>“We found him in a little cell, about twelve feet by
eight, engaged in reading a newspaper, which some
one had distributed among the prisoners. He did not
appear very glad to see his father, and spoke in a
surly manner to him. I really pitied the poor man,
for he felt so badly that he could hardly keep from
crying, when he saw the situation of his son. Oscar
did not know me, I suppose. I believe I never saw
him before, although I had often heard Willie speak
of him. Mr. Preston told him that I was a lawyer
whom he had engaged to manage his case, and he then
proceeded to tell him the conclusion we had arrived at.
‘I shan’t do it,’ he instantly replied; ‘I aint guilty,
and I wont say I am.’ ‘But,’ said I, ‘this is very
foolish in you, for here are the clearest proofs of your
guilt, and you can’t rub them out.’ ‘I don’t care,’ he
said, ‘I wont cave in now, any how. I mean to stick
it out to the last.’ I then told him we were afraid he
would be sentenced to the House of Correction, whereas,
if he confessed his guilt, we could probably get the
judge to send him to the Reform School. ‘I don’t
want to go to the Reform School,’ he replied; ‘of the
two, I’d rather go to the House of Correction. That
would be all over with, in two or three months; but if
I’m sent to the Reform School, I shall have to stay
three or four years, and I wont do it—I’ll run away
first.’ So he continued to talk, and we continued to
reason with him, but all in vain; and finally we left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
him, in no pleasant mood. This forenoon, I called on
him again, thinking he might have altered his mind,
by this time; but he was as obstinate as ever, and so
I must defend him to the best of my ability, when the
trial comes on, next month. Poor boy! I’m afraid
he will find the way of the transgressor is hard, before
he is many months older. He appears to be pretty intelligent,
and does not look like a bad boy, but he
seems bent on his vicious courses. I tried to appeal
to his feelings, to-day, but could not produce any effect
upon him. I’ll try to let you know how his case turns
out, when it comes to trial.</p>

<p>“Your Aunt Lizzy sends her love to you and to
your father, and mother, and dear little Annie. Willie
says, ‘Tell Clinton I’m going down to see him this

I guess it will pass only for a rumor. Sissy sends ’a

<p>There, now, I forgot to put in the wag—but no
matter, you can imagine that. Well, I’ve got to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
end of my sheet, and have only room to subscribe
myself,</p>

<p class="center no-indent">
Your affectionate</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Uncle Clinton</span>.”<br>
</p>
</div>
<br>

<p>After running over the letter, Clinton read it aloud
to his father and mother. The intelligence it gave
concerning Oscar, did not much surprise any of them,
though they felt sorry for him and his parents.</p>

<p>“I have seldom known a bad beginning to make a
good ending,” remarked Mr. Davenport. “Oscar
seems to have made a very poor start in life, and I’m
afraid he will not turn out any too well. It’s too bad,
for I always thought he was a bright, capable sort of a
boy, if he would only keep out of mischief. But I
suspect his parents never had much control over him,
and if that’s the case, they are as much to be blamed
as pitied.”</p>

<p>After conversing a while longer on Oscar’s case,
Mr. Davenport told Clinton he had better not mention
the subject out of the family, as it might reach the ears
of Jerry’s mother, and make her feel unpleasantly.
He also told Clinton he had concluded to let him go to
Boston in October, and that he might write to either<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span>
his Uncle Clinton or to his Cousin Willie, and inform
them of the fact. He also directed him to invite Willie
to come and spend his summer vacation with him, and
to extend the same invitation to the rest of the family.
Clinton accordingly wrote, a few days after, directing
the letter to his uncle, whose long epistle, he thought,
was entitled to an answer.</p>

<p>Clinton continued his daily labors in the garden,
which now began to give tokens of a fair harvest.
He set apart a portion of each day to this business,
and was always to be found engaged at his work, when
the set hour arrived. While weeding the beds, and
hoeing the corn and potatoes, and training the pea and
bean vines, his thoughts often wandered far away,—sometimes
to Jerry, now probably near the end of his
voyage; and sometimes to the little stone cell in which
Oscar was awaiting his trial.</p>

<p>June came, and as this was the month in which
Oscar’s case was to be decided, Clinton began to look
rather impatiently for a letter. He went to the post-office
two or three times a week, but still no letter
made its appearance. At length, however, his frequent
visits were rewarded by the reception of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</span>
newspaper, directed to himself, in the well-known hand
of his uncle. Tearing off the wrapper, and opening
the paper,—for he could not wait till he got home,—a
heavy black mark, drawn with a pen around a particular
item, at once met his eye. The article was
headed, “<em>Municipal Court</em>;” and after brief notices
of several trials, sentences, etc., came the marked paragraph,
which was as follows:—</p>

<p>“Oscar Preston, a minor, tried on two indictments
for larceny. Verdict guilty, and sentenced to the State
Reform School during his minority.”</p>

<p>This was all, and it told the whole story. Clinton
was disappointed that the information was not conveyed
by letter, which would have given him more particulars;
but he concluded his uncle was too busy to write,
and he felt glad he had not entirely forgotten him, in
the hurry of business. He hastened home, and
showed the short, sad record to his parents.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Davenport, on reading it, “that is
the best place for him. They may make something of
him yet.”</p>

<p>“What sort of a place is the Reform School?” inquired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span>
Clinton; “is it anything like a jail, or house of
correction?”</p>

<p>“Not much, I suppose,” replied his father; “boys are
sent there to be reformed and instructed, rather than
punished. I have never visited an institution of this
kind, myself, but I read quite a full description of the
one in Massachusetts, not long ago, and perhaps I can
find the paper that contained it. I will look over the
files, some day when I have leisure.”</p>

<p>One rainy afternoon, not long after this, Mr. Davenport
overhauled the papers referred to, and succeeded
in finding the description of the Massachusetts Reform
School. He gave it to Clinton, who was much interested
in it. The following is the substance of the
description:—</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_b269" style="max-width: 62.5em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_b269.jpg" alt="THE STATE REFORM SCHOOL, WESTBORO’.">
</figure>
<br>

<p>This institution is located in Westboro’, thirty-two
miles from Boston, and is designed to accommodate
five or six hundred boys. Any boy under sixteen
years of age, who has been convicted of an offence,
punishable by imprisonment, can be sentenced to the
Reform School instead of the prison, unless his crime
is a very aggravated one, such as the laws require to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span>be punished by imprisonment for life. When a boy
arrives at the School, he is first placed in the hands of
the steward, who strips, washes, and dresses him in a
suit of good clothes; he is then assigned to the field or
workshop, and is not allowed to converse with his companions
for two or three days, or until the superintendent
understands his character and disposition.
The boys are divided into four principal classes. The
new comers enter the first class, and by dint of good
conduct work their way up. Beyond the fourth is a
still higher class, reached only by a few, and known as
the class of “<em>Truth and Honor</em>.” To become a member
of this class, a boy must pass a certain number of
weeks without a demerit mark,—for a daily account of
the merits and demerits of each boy is kept, and at the
end of the week he is promoted or degraded, according
to his deserts. It is so difficult to get into the class of
“Truth and Honor,” that there are seldom more than
eight or ten members. They enjoy extraordinary
privileges,—are invited to the parlor of the superintendent,—have
extra hours to play and read, and receive
numerous special favors, greatly prized by them,
and desired by others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span></p>

<p>The daily order of business is as follows: The boys
rise at five o’clock in summer, make their beds, march
to the general wash-room, where they bathe their
hands and face; attend prayers at a quarter before
six; from six to seven for breakfast and play; work
from seven to ten, A. M., and from three to six, P. M.;
study from ten A. M., to three P. M., in two sessions
of two hours each, with an hour for dinner
and play, at noon; from six to seven, P. M., for
supper and play; from seven to eight for the hearing
and examination of all reports respecting the good or
bad conduct of the boys, and the settlement of cases
needing discipline which have occurred during the day.
On Sunday they have a Sabbath-school, and religious
worship in their chapel.</p>

<p>Many of the boys are employed in making shoes.
They not only make and mend all their own shoes, but
manufacture for dealers, who contract for their labor.
About eighty boys are employed in the tailor’s shop,
where all the clothing, bedding, etc., used in the institution,
are made and repaired. In the shops, no noise
or confusion is allowed during working hours. The
boys are arranged in divisions, to each of which there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
is a monitor, who has a slate on his bench, with the
names of the boys, in his division, written upon it, and
when one of them commits a fault, the disciplinarian
gives notice of the fact to the monitor,—who makes a
demerit mark opposite to the delinquent’s name.</p>

<p>A portion of the boys are employed upon the farm,
which embraces nearly three hundred acres. Then,
there is the laundry, in which some twenty boys do the
washing and ironing, under the direction of a matron;
and the kitchen, in which several boys do the cooking
and baking, etc.</p>

<p>Boys, committed to the Reform School, are kept till
they are reformed and discharged, or bound out as apprentices
to mechanics and farmers, or sent to prison if
they are found to be incorrigible. They cannot be
committed to the institution for less than one year, or
for a longer term than during their minority.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Davenport, after Clinton had finished
reading the account, “now you can imagine in
what sort of a place Oscar is living, and what he is
about,—for I suppose he has been sent to the Reform
School before this.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Clinton, “and I guess it will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
come rather hard to him, at first, to go to work, don’t
you?”</p>

<p>“No doubt it will,—but I suppose, if he can be
made to form habits of industry and obedience, it will
be comparatively easy to save him, even now.”</p>

<p>“I hope he will get into the class of ‘Truth and
Honor,’” added Clinton.</p>

<p>“Ah,” said his father, “what a pity it is that boys
ever get <em>out</em> of that class! It is much easier to stay in
it, than it is to get back again after a person has been
once expelled from it. When you think of Oscar’s
unhappy career, Clinton, I want you to remember what
it was that led to it; and, beware, how you swerve a
single hair from the line of <span class="allsmcap">TRUTH AND HONOR</span>.”</p>

<p>Perhaps Mr. Davenport was thinking of Clinton’s
entanglement in Jerry’s artful snares, the previous winter,
when he uttered this warning; but he never directly
alluded to that affair, since his son had given such
unequivocal evidence of sorrow for his offence. Clinton,
indeed, had already more than made up, by his
exemplary conduct, what he lost in the good opinion
of his parents by his unhappy connection with Jerry.
He had the wisdom to profit by his experience, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
the lesson which he learned from his temptation and
fall, he will probably never forget. For the present,
however, we must bid him good-by. Should the readers
of this volume wish to know something further of
his history, it is possible that I may be able to gratify
their curiosity, some time or other.</p>

<p>This work is considered fully equal, if not superior, to either of the Chambers’s

<p>This work, by Captain Bourne,—who was taken captive and retained three months
by the Patagonians,—gives an account of his capture and final escape; a description
of this strange people; their manners, customs, habits, pursuits; the country, its soil
productions, etc., of which little or nothing has heretofore been known. ☞ A work
of thrilling interest, and of instruction to every class of readers.</p>

<p>Any book, descriptive of a country which is almost like fable land to the civilized
world, must possess great interest; but this work, besides having <em>this</em> attraction, is
written with much vigor and spirit, and is replete with a variety of interesting facts,
descriptive of the manners, customs, character, etc., of the Patagonians.—<cite>Sav. Jour.</cite></p>

<p>A work of thrilling interest, and bids fair to be another Uncle Tom’s Cabin. Captain
Bourne is well known and highly respected in this community; and the narrative
of his strange adventures, startling and romantic as they may seem, can be relied
upon as strictly true.—<cite>Nantucket Eagle.</cite></p>

<p>This work embraces about <em>one thousand authors</em>, chronologically arranged and

with choice selections from their writings, connected by a Biographical, Historical,
and Critical Narrative; thus presenting a complete view of English literature from

<p>This work has been highly recommended by distinguished individuals, as admirably

<p>It would be difficult to find any miscellany superior or even equal to it; it richly

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">By <span class="smcap">Hugh Miller</span>, author of “Old Red Sandstone,” “Footprints
of the Creator,” etc., with a fine likeness of the author. 12mo, 1,00.</p>

<p>Let not the careless reader imagine, from the title of this book, that it is a common
book of travels, on the contrary, it is a very remarkable one, both in design, spirit, and
execution. The facts recorded, and the views advanced in this book, are so fresh,
vivid, and natural, that we cannot but commend it as a treasure, both of information
and entertainment.—<cite>Willis’s Home Journal.</cite></p>

<p>This is a noble book, worthy of the author of the Footprints of the Creator and the
Old Red Sandstone, because it is seasoned with the same power of vivid description,
the same minuteness of observation, and soundness of criticism, and the same genial
piety. We have read it with deep interest, and with ardent admiration of the author’s
temper and genius. It is almost impossible to lay the book down, even to attend
to more pressing matters. It is, without compliment or hyperbole, a most delightful
volume.—<cite>N. Y. Commercial.</cite></p>

<p>This is a most amusing and instructive book, by a master hand.—<cite>Dem. Rev.</cite></p>

<p>The author of this work proved himself, in the Footprints of the Creator, one of the
most original thinkers and powerful writers of the age. In the volume before us he
adds new laurels to his reputation. Whoever wishes to understand the character of
the present race of Englishmen, as contradistinguished from past generations; to
comprehend the workings of political, social, and religious agitation in the minds, not
of the nobility or gentry, but of the <em>people</em>, will discover that, in this volume, he has
found a treasure.—<cite>Peterson’s Magazine.</cite></p>

<p>His eyes were open to see, and his ears to hear, every thing; and, as the result of
what he saw and heard in “merrie” England, he has made one of the most spirited
and attractive volumes of travels and observations that we have met with.—<cite>Trav.</cite></p>

<p>Hugh Miller is one of the most agreeable, entertaining, and instructive writers of
the age. We know of no work in England so full of adaptedness to the age as this.
It opens up clearly to view the condition of its various classes, sheds new light into
its social, moral, and religious history, its geological peculiarities, and draws conclusions
of great value.—<cite>Albany Spectator.</cite></p>

<p>The author, one of the most remarkable men of the age, arranged for this journey
into England, expecting to “lodge in humble cottages, and wear a humble dress, and
see what was to be seen by humble men only,—society without its mask.” Such an
observer might be expected to bring to view a thousand things unknown, or partially
known before; and abundantly does he fulfil this expectation. It is one of the most
absorbing books of the time.—<cite>Portland Ch. Mirror.</cite></p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em; text-indent: -2em;">A NARRATIVE OF THE EXCURSION MADE BY MR.
VANDERBILT’S PARTY, IN THE STEAM YACHT, in her
Voyage to England, Russia, Denmark, France, Spain, Italy,
Malta, Turkey, Madeira, etc. By Rev. <span class="smcap">John Overton Choules</span>,
D. D. With elegant Illustrations, and fine Likenesses of Commodore
Vanderbilt and Capt. Eldridge. 12mo, cloth, gilt backs
and sides. $1.50.</p>

<p>The cruise of the North Star was an event of almost national concern, and
was watched with universal interest. This volume is as different from ordinary
books of travel as the cruise of the North Star was different from an ordinary
trip to Europe. We need not bespeak for it many readers.—<cite>Providence Jour.</cite></p>

<p>The American people ought to be proud of, and grateful to, Cornelius Vanderbilt.
This man has done more than a dozen presidents to give America a
respected name in Europe. In the person of Cornelius Vanderbilt, American
enterprise told the people of Europe what it could do. The desire to get this
curious narrative was so great that the whole of the first edition went off in two
days!—<cite>Star of the West.</cite></p>

<p>Those who remember to have met with a very interesting work, published
some two years ago, entitled “Young Americans Abroad,” will be glad to learn
that here is another book of travels from the same source. Do you say your
shelves are all full of books of travel?—we reply, with Leigh Hunt,—then put
in another shelf, and place this one on it.—<cite>Methodist Protestant.</cite></p>

<p>The work is one of the most entertaining, and, in its way, vivid, portraitures
of scenes in the Old World, that we have ever seen.—<cite>Boston Transcript.</cite></p>

<p>The book is in many respects as novel as the occasion which produced it was
unique and memorable. Both the accomplished author and the publishers deserve
the best thanks for so tasteful a record of a performance which has reflected
so much credit abroad upon American enterprise.—<cite>N. Y. Courier &amp; Enquirer.</cite></p>

<p>This work is interesting, not only as a memorial of the North Star, and her
trip to Europe, but also as a record of European travel, narrated in a lively
manner, by a gentleman whose taste and attainments eminently qualify him
for the task.—<cite>New York Times.</cite></p>

<p>Never before did a private individual make so magnificent an excursion as
Mr. Vanderbilt. Dr. Choules, who was one of his guests, has given to the world
a charming account of this unique voyage, in a beautifully printed and illustrated
volume. We commend it to our readers as a very entertaining, well-written
book.—<cite>Zion’s Herald.</cite></p>

<p>The book will be eagerly perused, as a record of one of the unique occurrences
of the age; is written with a kind of drawing-room, etiquette-like style, is mellow
in sentiment, and is wholly destitute of that straining after the sublime,
and stranding in the “high-falutin,” that characterize the effusions of the tourist
generally.—<cite>Chicago Advertiser.</cite></p>

<p>This beautiful volume describes, in a chaste and readable manner, the fortunes
of the widely-known excursion of the princely New York merchant and
his family and guests. From the eclat of the voyage itself, and the pleasant
way of Dr. Choules’ account of it, we think the book is destined to have—what
it deserves—a very large sale.—<cite>Congregationalist.</cite></p>

<p>Well, the boys have read it, and pronounce it “<em>first-rate</em>.” We confirm their
judgment. It enters into the heart of the boy; comprehends his thoughts, his
wishes, and his temptations; mingles in his sports; stimulates him in his
studies, and implants right principles and noble views. It is a safe book, an
entertaining book, and a useful book.—<cite>The Independent, N. Y.</cite></p>

<p>We attempted to read this book, but the boys got hold of it, and, morning,
noon, and night, they kept hold of it, until one, and another, and another still,
had read it through. If their judgment is worth anything, the book is capital,
one of the very best of its kind.—<cite>N. Y. Evangelist.</cite></p>

<p>We like “Clinton” for its naturalness. It is a narrative about real life, pleasantly
described in just the way to attract young readers, resembling, and quite
equal to, the “Rollo” series.—<cite>Christian Register.</cite></p>

<p>A better book, as a mere book of combined amusement and instruction for
boys, could scarcely be found.—<cite>Saturday Evening Mail.</cite></p>

<p>“<em>A prime book</em>,” as we heard a little boy say who had just got through with
it.—<cite>Youth’s Companion, Boston.</cite></p>

<p>A better book a boy can hardly read.—<cite>Forrester’s Boys’ and Girls’ Magazine.</cite></p>

<p>The boy who begins it is sure to peruse it from title-page to finis; and he who
does so can hardly fail of wishing to be a better and wiser boy.—<cite>Zion’s Herald.</cite></p>

<p>One of the best books for boys we have ever seen. Its descriptions are exact,
and all its details are those of actual life. Its moral and religious influence is excellent.—<cite>Congregationalist.</cite></p>
